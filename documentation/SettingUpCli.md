# Setting Up (CLI)
- After requesting access to Nimbella [here](https://tender-darwin-834905.netlify.com/request/), you will receive an email with your credentials.  Copy the attached files `.wskprops` and `.objectstorecreds`.  Confirm that the files are in place by running `ls -l ~/.wskprops ~/.objectstorecreds`.  The output should be similar to this:

```
perry:~$ ls -l ~/.wskprops ~/.objectstorecreds 
-rw-r--r--@ 1 perry  staff  2309 Jul  1 14:00 /Users/perry/.objectstorecreds
-rw-r--r--  1 perry  staff   144 Jul  1 14:00 /Users/perry/.wskprops

```
- More coming soon!
