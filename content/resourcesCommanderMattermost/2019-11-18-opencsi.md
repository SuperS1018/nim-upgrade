          OpenCSI stands for Open Command Set Interface. Similar to how OpenAPI
          decribes an API, OpenCSI describes a set of commands.


          An OpenCSI description is YAML format file that describes a set of
          commands, the parameters they take and (usually) the location for the
          source code for each command.


          You can install an OpenCSI-described command set into a messaging app
          in Commander using the
          [csm_install](/docs/commander/mattermost/reference#csm_install)
          command.


          This command set containing these 3 commands:


          1. **host_add <hostname> \[<ip_address>] -ttl <seconds> -just_a_flag**
             This first command has a description of "Adds a host" and the source code of the command is located at https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ericswildens/shepard@latest/src/host_add.js
          2. **host_delete <hostname>**
             This second command has a description of "Deletes a host" and the source code of the command is located at https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ericswildens/shepard@latest/src/host_delete.js
          3. **host_list <match>**
             This third command has a description of host_list "Lists hosts" and the source code of the command is located at https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ericswildens/shepard@latest/src/host_list.js

          Can be described in OpenCSI with:
