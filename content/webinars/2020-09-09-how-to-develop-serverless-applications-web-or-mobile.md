Apptimia, in collaboration with Nimbella, is inviting you to join a 45-minute session with Dr. Rodric Rabbah to receive the latest updates on the most promising computing paradigm, Serverless. 

Mieszko Mularczyk, CEO of Apptimia will host Dr. Rodric Rabbah, CTO & Co-founder at Nimbella, the serverless cloud provider. Rodric was a Principal Researcher at IBM, where he created Apache OpenWhisk, the open-source and enterprise-grade serverless computing platform powering IBM Cloud Functions, Adobe I/O Runtime, Naver Corporation and numerous private enterprise offerings. He was a Research Scientist at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) for several years after completing his Ph.D. from Georgia Tech. He founded Nimbella two years ago with the goal of making the cloud developer experience beautiful and accessible to developers of all skill sets.

During this session, you will discover how simple serverless is, the best practices to develop cloud-native apps, and the power and the speed of your development. You can also deploy your own first serverless app during the session. 

## The Agenda:

**14:00 - 14:05 PM** Introduction

**14:05 - 14:35 PM **How to develop serverless web applications by Dr. Rodric Rabbah

This session will demonstrate how Nimbella has radically transformed serverless technology in the past year with one goal in mind: to empower developers to implement stateful APIs and complete applications that are 100% serverless. Applications include Chatbots, Mobile Apps, AI/ML, and Jamstack, which all use serverless technology with the simplicity of methodology and the superiority of the developer experience that serverless computing promises. Simply put, you will love doing less while delivering more in the cloud.
