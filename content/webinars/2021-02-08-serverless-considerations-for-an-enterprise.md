Serverless Computing allows developers to build and run applications without the added work of managing the infrastructure. [Rishidot Research](https://rishidot.com/) estimates that the Serverless Computing market will cross $20 Billion in the next five years and almost every enterprise will have Serverless deployments in their organization. Enterprises will see the financial and operational benefits in serverless platforms such as [Nimbella](https://nimbella.com) through the reduction of operational overhead and costs to manage the infrastructure, increased developer productivity, and quicker deployment to market from an abstraction of infrastructure complexities resulting in a better ROI. 

In the webinar, two experts in cloud and serverless will present the latest trend and the overview of the recently released whitepaper overview on  "[The State of Serverless in the Enterprise](https://nimbella.com/whitepaper)" authored by Rishidot Research. This whitepaper is designed to help you understand how you can maximize your investments with serverless. 

During this webinar you will discover: 

* Why should enterprises adopt serverless
* What is needed in serverless cloud platforms for enterprise workloads
* How Nimbella, an enterprise focussed serverless platform fits into the enterprise needs

We invite you to join the discussion about some of the considerations for enterprise decision-makers as they evaluate serverless platforms for their use.
