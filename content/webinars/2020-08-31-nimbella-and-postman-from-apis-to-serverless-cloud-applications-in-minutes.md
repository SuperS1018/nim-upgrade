APIs are at the heart of all modern-day applications. With [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), developers can design and test their APIs, and generate mock servers to facilitate the development of cloud and mobile applications. Today, we're taking the Postman developer journey to the next level, with Nimbella.

Nimbella offers a Serverless Computing experience that allows developers to quickly build and run cloud applications without worrying about infrastructure operations or management. As a result, developers enjoy an increased focus on the core value they want to deliver with their application logic.

With Postman and Nimbella, developers can use the tools they know and love, and truly enjoy a full stack development experience. Now you can go from API design to full cloud implementations. Nimbella makes it easy to develop stateless and stateful APIs, offers integrated key-value and object stores, and is backed by proven enterprise-grade open source technologies.

 In this webinar, Postman's Kin Lane and Nimbella's co-founder Rodric Rabbah will discuss the Nimbella Serverless Cloud integration for Postman, and demonstrate the full developer experience, going from API to fully operational cloud application in minutes.
