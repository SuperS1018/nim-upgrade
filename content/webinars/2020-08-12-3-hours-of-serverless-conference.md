# The Future of Computing is Serverless

We're thrilled to bring you this event, with serverless experts from around the world. If you are new to serverless, our talks promise an entertaining introduction. If you're a practitioner looking for deeper insights into architecting applications for the age of serverless, we have you covered. And if you want to learn about the future of serverless computing, and hear about innovations on the horizon, we have something for you too. We encourage participation from developers with diverse skillsets and expertise, hackers, open-source enthusiasts, and students interested in jumping into an exciting and rapidly evolving field of research and innovation.

**We have speakers from all around the world to bring different perspectives.** Join us with a cup of morning coffee or late evening snack. We look forward to meeting you all virtually.

## Abstract

### Become Thanos of the LambdaLand: Wield all the Infinity Stones

In the ever fast-paced software development, Serverless came in as a boon, enabling developers to concentrate only on the business logic and nothing more! But, the flip side is most devs tend to neglect the best practices and essential principles, eventually have to pay higher technical debts. 

Each infinity stone has one significant power, even in the land of lambdas! The six stones are: Space (code size), Time (time), Mind (code), Power (memory), Soul (design principles), Reality (pragmatics). Wielding all of them was not easy, not even for the Mad Titan - Thanos. This talk signifies the importance of Lambda best practices and how you can wield them into a gauntlet and use it to snap more than half of your problems/bugs. This talk focuses on various real-life scenarios and experiences relating to the best practices, how and when to apply them, and finally when to violate them.

### PHP in a Serverless World

PHP is arguably the most widely used language for writing web applications and is ideal for writing serverless applications too. This session explores PHP in a serverless environment where we'll cover designing, building and deploying for serverless platforms. We'll leverage the API gateway to turn incoming HTTP requests into events that trigger those serverless functions, creating robust APIs quickly and easily. By the end of the talk, you'll appreciate that PHP and serverless really do work well together.

### Speeding up Serverless Functions by Language-based Isolation

We will take a look under the hood of serverless computing, focusing on how serverless platforms isolate serverless functions, written by different users, from each other. Today's serverless platforms run functions in containers and virtual machines, but these technologies have a cost. We present an alternative approach that uses language-based isolation, and can significantly lower the latency and resource utilization of a large class of serverless functions. Our prototype is built in Rust and is open source.

### Building Resilient Serverless Systems with "Non-Serverless" Components

Serverless functions have the ability to scale almost infinitely. While great for compute, it can be a MAJOR PROBLEM for other downstream resources. In this talk, we'll discuss strategies and patterns to create highly resilient serverless apps that mitigate pressure on "non-serverless" systems.

CMS-ANCHOR ID=stateful-serverless-and-stateful-apis

### Stateful Serverless and Stateful APIs

This talk will demonstrate how Nimbella  has radically transformed severless technology in the last year with one goal in mind: Empower developers to implement stateful APIs and complete applications that are 100% serverless. Applications that include Chatbots, Mobile Apps, AI/ML, and Jamstack. All using serverless technology, and with the simplicity of methodology, and superiority of the developer experience that serverless computing promises. Simply put: you will love doing less, while delivering more in the cloud.
