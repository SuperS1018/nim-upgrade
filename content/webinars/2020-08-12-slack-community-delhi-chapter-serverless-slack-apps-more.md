In our first virtual meetup for [Slack Delhi NCR chapter,](https://slackcommunity.com/delhincr/) let's learn how to create serverless Slack apps using a third-party tool called Nimbella Commander, and how to build steps from apps for Slack's Workflow Builder. 

**Building a serverless Slack App
**

Commander is a Slack app that provides a framework for developers to create custom serverless slash commands and serverless Slack apps without leaving the Slack environment. Commander is an app that simplifies your workflow to build custom apps. The commands which are created using Commander are serverless commands which run on Nimbella’s Serverless Cloud. There's nothing to install, no servers to manage, and no services you need to provision. Simplifying the process of creating Apps and slash commands allows you to quickly create or install functionality for your team to more efficiently communicate with each other.

**How to build Steps from apps for Workflow Builder
**

Workflows are automated multi-step tasks or processes within Slack. Anyone can create workflows with no code using Workflow Builder. Workflow steps from apps provide an ability for Slack apps to create and process custom workflow steps. These steps from apps can be shared and used by anyone in Workflow Builder. Use steps from apps to send data to external services, create tasks in project management systems, or update tickets.
