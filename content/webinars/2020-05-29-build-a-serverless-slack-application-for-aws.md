**Presentation:

This presentation will show you how to build serverless Slack apps using Nimbella Commander. We’ll build an app to manage resources in your AWS account. Example commands will include managing EC2 instances, interacting with DynamoDB, updating Route53 configurations, and retrieving your AWS bill. All conveniently built as serverless Slack apps, using Nimbella Commander. No new tools or accounts needed.
