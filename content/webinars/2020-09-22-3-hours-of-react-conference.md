is normally written in JavaScript. We'll show how to develop and deploy a complete React
app that includes user login and talk about best practices for maintaining user-state and
securing back end APIs.

**All attendees will receive:**

1. A certificate for attending this conference.
2. The Pro version of Nimbella's serverless cloud platform free for 3 months.
3. Access to the Nimbella community Slack channel to ask questions about building their serverless apps and share what they are building.
