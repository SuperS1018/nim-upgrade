      # OCR Tutorial


      This tutorial explains the [Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
      demo](https://github.com/nimbella/demo-projects/tree/master/ocr) available
      on GitHub and shows you how to deploy it to the Nimbella Cloud.


      The OCR application displays a web page where visitors select a language
      (English, Spanish, or Chinese) and then drag a JPG, GIF, or PNG image onto
      the page, where it is automatically converted to text. If the conversion
      is successful, users can read the text and click a **Speak** button to
      hear the text. You can [try out the application
      here](https://ocrdemo-apigcp.nimbella.io).


      The OCR demo is an example of a serverless Nimbella Cloud application with
      a [React front end](https://reactjs.org) and several functions on the back
      end. The [Tesseract OCR
      Engine](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) converts the images to
      text.


      The OCR demo has the following code and configuration components,
      described in more detail later:


      * Application logic: The _packages_ directory contains several Nimbella
      actions, which are logical collections of functions.

      * Static web content: The _web_ directory contains a _public_ directory,
      with the files that will be part of the public website, and a _src_
      directory with React component files and other JavaScript files that are
      built into the _index.html_ template page to produce the final static
      public page.

      * Slack application: A Nimbella Commander project folder called
      _commander_, with an _ocr.js_ file with an app that can be installed into
      Slack.


      ### Project structure and logic


      Nimbella relies on directory and file structure to intelligently deploy
      projects, so the GitHub project directory structure is organized that way
      and is described below. For more information about creating and deploying
      Nimbella Cloud projects, see the [Nimbella Command Line Tool (nim)
      Guide](https://docs.nimbella.com/).


      In the following diagrams,  files that contain code or web content are
      shown with file icons and larger font labels, while project configuration
      and build files are displayed in smaller fonts without icons.


      #### Top-level directories


      CMS-IMAGECLASS IMAGE=/images/uploads/ocrtutorial-top_level_directories.png
      INDENT=0 CLASS=w75 ALT=OCR Tutorial - Top-level directories


      In any Nimbella project, the deployer looks for one or both of the
      following top-level directories:


      * The _packages_ directory, which contains the back end logic of the
      project.

      * The _web_ directory, which contains static web content published to be
      published to the front end of the application.


      The _packages_ and _web_ directory contents are described in the following
      sections.


      There are also several configuration files. The _project.yml_ file in the
      OCR demo configures the object store bucket provided with your Nimbella
      Cloud namespace for web content and database instances.


      #### Actions in the packages directory


      Actions are discrete units of functional code in languages such as
      JavaScript, Node.js, or PHP. Actions are usually divided into packages,
      and the deployer identifies the packages and actions from the directory
      and file structure.


      In this case, the _packages_ directory contains two  packages with six
      total actions, shown in this diagram and described below:


      CMS-IMAGECLASS IMAGE=/images/uploads/ocrtutorial-actions.png INDENT=0
      CLASS=w75 ALT=OCR Tutorial - Actions in the packages directory


      * The `ocr` package contains five actions:
        * **acceptImage**
          Provides a workflow that sequences other actions, invoking the `ocr/imageToText` action at the proper point and invoking the `utils/slack` action to send a notification and the OCR results to Slack (assuming the Commander app is installed into Slack).
        * **credential**
          This action specifies secure get and put operations between the web page and the storage bucket.
        * **imageToText**
          Provides logic for the Tesseract conversion of the image to text.
        * **progress**
          Uses the Redis key-value store provided with your Nimbella namespace to track progress, status, and the OCR text to be displayed.
        * **textToSpeech**
          Routes the text through Google Translate to be synthesized to speech.
      * The `utils` package, which contains one action:
        * **slack**
          Logic for Slack notifications for the Commander app.

      Packages are used as qualifiers in action names, so the full action names
      are therefore `ocr/acceptImage`, `ocr/credential`, `utils/slack`, and so
      on.


      ##### Build files


      Some of the action directories have build files, which trigger an
      automatic build within the directory in which it's placed any time the
      code file is modified. In the case of the _acceptImage_ directory, there's
      a _build.sh_ file, which contains shell commands to run an `npm install`
      and `npm run build` of that directory. The _package.json_ file specifies
      the common Node.js dependencies of the code.


      ### Web content


      The Nimbella deployer looks for a directory called _web_ for static web
      content. The OCR demo contains the  _web_ directory structure shown in the
      following diagram.


      CMS-IMAGECLASS IMAGE=/images/uploads/ocrtutorial-web_directory.png
      INDENT=0 CLASS=w75 ALT=OCR Tutorial - Web content


      #### Top-level web directory structure


      The _web/public_ directory contains the files that will appear in the
      public website location. The public/index.html_ file is a template for the
      content that will be generated with React UI components and other
      JavaScript in the _src_ directory. The _public/manifest.json_ file
      provides metadata used [when your web app is added to the homescreen on
      Android](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/).


      The _build.sh_ file in the _web_ directory runs _npm install_ and _npm run
      build_ to generate content from the _src_ directory's React components
      into the _index.html_ file. This happens automatically every time a file
      is modified.


      #### src directory structure


      The starting point of the React logic is _index.js_ in the _src_
      directory. It imports various React components and CSS, and it imports and
      renders _App.js_ from the _components_ subdirectory.


      _App.js_ contains the sequencing of the other components. It imports
      _Header_, _FileUpload_, and _Result_. It also adds handlers for various
      components (language, browsing, camera, file upload) and creates some of
      the HTML markup. The `Result` code imports the `ImageDisplay` and
      `TextDisplay` components that control how the image and text are displayed
      after OCR occurs. If you've tried the demo, it's easy to see what these
      components refer to.


      ### Deploy this project to the Nimbella Cloud


      If you have the [Nimbella command line tool called
      `nim`](https://docs.nimbella.com/install)
      installed, you can deploy this project directly from GitHub, either online
      or from the local repository  cloned to your  disk.


      * Run the following command in your terminal:
         `nim project deploy /path/to/ocr`

      The output of this command will include a link to where the application is
      running in the cloud.

      # QR Code Tutorial


      This tutorial explains the [QR Code
      demo](https://github.com/nimbella/demo-projects/tree/master/qrcode)
      available on GitHub and shows you how to deploy it to the Nimbella Cloud.


      The QR Code demo is a stateless single-page web application that generates
      a [QR code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code) from text that a user
      submits. You can [view the app here](https://qrdemo-apigcp.nimbella.io).

      The QR Code demo has the following code and configuration components:


      * A single index.html file, which has a field for a visitor to enter some
      text and click **Submit**.

      * A single JavaScript file that provides the backend logic for the
      conversion of text to QR code.

      * A Node package manager file called _package.json_, which describes what
      dependencies the function has.


      ### Project file structure


      The GitHub project has the file structure that Nimbella uses to
      intelligently deploy the project:


      CMS-IMAGECLASS IMAGE=/images/uploads/qrcodetutorial-file_structure.png
      INDENT=0 CLASS=w50 ALT=QR Code Tutorial - Project file structure


      The _packages_ directory contains the project's actions, and in this
      example, there's only one. The first subdirectory name usually serves as
      the package qualifier, but when it's named _default_, no qualifier is
      prepended to the action name. The next subdirectory, _qr_, is the name of
      the action, and the _qr.js_ file contains the logic for that action.


      The _web_ directory contains the  web content for the project. In this
      case, there is just one HTML file and one image. The _index.html_ file
      contains a form with a text box for the user to input the text that will
      be converted.


      ### Notes on QR logic


      The code for the QR action is standard Node.js. It uses an existing Node
      [library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qrcode) for the actual code
      generation.


      ### Notes on QR web content


      The _index.html_ file contains the usual markup and logic that you'd write
      for standard web deployment, with an input form for text. In this case, it
      calls an API to retrieve a QR code for the form input. This API is
      implemented by _qr.js_.


      ### Notes on package.json


      The _package.json_ file in the _qr_ directory triggers an automatic build
      of the action when the _qr.js_ file is modified. For more information
      about builds, see the [section on incorporating build steps in the
      Nimbella Command Line Tool
      document](https://docs.nimbella.com/building).


      ### Deploy this project to the Nimbella Cloud


      If you have the [Nimbella command line tool called
      `nim`](https://docs.nimbella.com/install)
      installed, you can deploy this project directly from GitHub, either online
      or from the local repository  cloned to your  disk.


      * Run the following command in your terminal:
         `nim project deploy /path/to/qrcode`
         The output of this command will include a link to where the application is running in the cloud.

      # Page Visit Counter Tutorial


      This tutorial describes the [Visits
      demo](https://github.com/nimbella/demo-projects/tree/master/visits) and
      shows you how to deploy it to the Nimbella Cloud.


      The Visits app is stateful and displays on a web page how many times the
      page has been uniquely visited since the project was deployed. You can
      [view the app here](LINK).


      This project has the following components:


      * A web front end with a single HTML file.

      * Two functions in the back end, implemented with PHP, which create and
      manage the cookie for the app, and increment the data store of the visit
      count.


      ### Project file structure


      The GitHub project has the file structure that Nimbella uses to deploy the
      project with minimal configuration. Here is the directory structure for
      the Visits project:


      CMS-IMAGECLASS IMAGE=/images/uploads/visitstutorial-file_structure.png
      INDENT=0 CLASS=w50 ALT=Page Visit Counter Tutorial - Project file
      structure


      #### Actions


      Actions are located under the _packages_ directory and determined by the
      subdirectory structure. In this case, the subdirectory called _visits_
      serves as a qualifier for the project's two actions. The _visits_
      directory contains two PHP files, which are determined to be two actions:
      `visits/counter` and `visits/info`.


      * The code for the `counter` action in _counter.php_ creates an instance
      of a [Redis key-value store](https://redis.io) that is built into the
      Nimbella Cloud. It checks for a cookie first, and if none is found, it
      increments the count by one and writes to the cookie.

      * The `info` action checks for a file in the data bucket returns its
      contents, which are the date since the project was deployed. If it can't
      find the file, it creates one and adds the current date.


      #### Static web content


      The _web_ directory contains  static web content for the project. In this
      case, there is one HTML file and a logo image.


      The _index.html_ file contains JavaScript that displays the number of
      unique visitors and the date that the count started.


      ### No other configuration or build instructions required


      With this directory structure, you don't need any project  configuration
      or specific build instructions to deploy this project in the Nimbella
      Cloud. Just run the deployment command in the next section.


      ### Deploy this project to the Nimbella Cloud


      If you have the [Nimbella command line tool called
      `nim`](https://docs.nimbella.com/install)
      installed, you can deploy this project directly from GitHub, either online
      or from the local repository  cloned to your  disk.


      * Run the following command in your terminal:
         `nim project deploy /path/to/visits`

      The output of this command will include a link to where the application is
      running in the cloud.

  title: Serverless Stateful Cloud Computing Examples and Use Cases
---
# Use Cases

Developers are highly motivated professionally and personally to improve their productivity and accelerate delivery of new business solutions. Increasingly, developers are adopting Serverless computing offerings to rapidly attain new levels of productivity. Here we offer some examples of using the Nimbella Serverless platform. Note that Nimbella significantly expands the potential uses of Serverless by automatically handling State and eliminating run duration limits.

## Web Application

![Web Application](/images/uploads/usecase_web-application.png)
 Requests from web users are forwarded to Nimbella functions for processing. Nimbella functions then update the processed content in the database. If the state is shared between different Nimbella function compute instances, it is automatically managed by Nimbella functions memory.

## Real-Time Data

![Real-Time Data](/images/uploads/usecase_real-time-data-processing.png)
Processing Nimbella functions can be triggered from pub/sub topics or from event logs, giving an elastic, scalable event pipeline without the maintenance of complicated clusters. These event streaming pipelines can power the analytics systems, update secondary data stores and caches, or feed monitoring systems. Nimbella can process from any event stream such as Kafka, RabbitMQ and others.

## IoT (Internet of Things)

![IoT](/images/uploads/usecase_iot-processing.png)
The IoT Gateway pushes IoT device status to Nimbella functions for processing. Nimbella offers a way to efficiently and transparently transmit the processed data to other products, such as writing to a database or pushing data to desktop or mobile clients.

## AI/ML (Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning)

![AI/ML](/images/uploads/usecase_ai-ml.png)
This is not a typical serverless use case because it requires state to be shared between functions. Today serverless workflows typically compose APIs, functions and events to automate processes but in AI/ML use cases, the automation is more complicated. Instead of just triggering events in a serverless workflow, with Nimbella functions it is possible for workflows to also refer back to previous instances of running that workflow and see when the optimal outcome was achieved.
