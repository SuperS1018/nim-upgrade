          OpenCSI stands for Open Command Set Interface. Similar to how OpenAPI
          describes an API, OpenCSI describes a set of commands.


          An OpenCSI description is YAML format file that describes a set of
          commands and the parameters they take.


          The YAML file is expected to be placed in a directory structure that
          includes the source for the commands described in the YAML file under
          a "packages" subdirectory.


          As an example, if we created a command set called "hoststuff" that
          included commands "host_add", "host_delete" and "host_list", we would
          put the commands.yaml in the top level directory.


          We would then create a "packages" subdirectory and another
          subdirectory under it with the name of the command set. In that
          subdirectory, we could create a subdirectory with the name of each
          command. The files in that subdirectory would contain the source for
          the command and for Javascript, it can include package.json and
          related files.


          The full directory structure of the "hoststuff" command set would be:


          >   /commands.yaml

          >   /packages/hoststuff/host_add/index.js

          >   /packages/hoststuff/host_add/package.json

          >   /packages/hoststuff/host_delete/index.js

          >   /packages/hoststuff/host_delete/package.json

          >   /packages/hoststuff/host_list/index.js

          >   /packages/hoststuff/host_list/package.json


          With the commands.yaml containing the OpenCSI specification describing
          the commands and the other files being the source code and dependent
          packages for each command.


          One quick way to start creating your own command set is with one of
          the examples in the command set registry here:

          You can install an OpenCSI-described command set into a Slack app in
          Commander using the
          [csm_install](/docs/commander/slack/reference#csm_install) command.


          This command set containing these 3 commands:


          1. **host_add <hostname> \[<ip_address>] \[-ttl <seconds>]
          \[-just_a_flag]**
             This first command requires a hostname parameter, has an optional ip address parameter and 2 options. It has a description of "Adds a host"
          2. **host_delete <hostname>**
             This second command requires a single hostname parameter. It has a description of "Deletes a host"
          3. **host_list <match>**
             This third command requires a single match parameter. It has a description of host_list "Lists hosts"

          Can be described in OpenCSI with:


          ```
