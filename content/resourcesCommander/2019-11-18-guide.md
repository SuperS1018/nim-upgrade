          Commander provides a full development and runtime environment for
          developing custom Slack apps. There are a number of advantages to
          using Commander to develop, host, and maintain your custom apps.


          ### You don’t need your own server


          Commander lets you host and run Slack apps in the Nimbella Cloud, so
          you don’t have to deploy your own server. After you create a listing
          for your custom app on the Slack API apps page, you create one slash
          command and point the slash command’s Request URL to a Commander URL.
          Your app’s custom code lives in the Nimbella cloud, and Nimbella
          servers respond to slash commands developed for your app. 


          The slash command you create for your custom app at the Slack API site
          serves as a command prefix for your app’s commands. When users run
          commands for the app, they always begin with this prefix. For example,
          if you have a custom app called DevOps with a command prefix of
          `/devops`, then your app responds to any slash commands that have the
          form `/devops <command>`.


          ### Selective listening


          Most custom Slack apps function as bots, listening to all messages in
          a public channel and responding to direct requests. The apps you
          create with Commander don't read messages in channels. They only
          respond to slash commands with the appropriate command prefix. This
          means you don't have to worry about your custom Slack app reading
          messages in your public or private channels.


          ### Create custom commands and administer your app right in Slack


          After you install the Commander app in Slack, you can create custom
          slash commands and administer your custom app from the Slack
          interface. See the tutorial in the [Quickstart
          Guide](/docs/commander/slack/quickstart) for an example of creating a
          custom slash command in the Slack UI.


          ### Easy to code


          Commands are written in JavaScript, and premium versions of Commander
          allow other options such as the Node.js runtime. This means custom
          apps can be developed by app developers or even DevOps staff who know
          shell scripting.


          ### Advanced features


          * Administrators assign [user roles]($create-manage-user-roles-groups)
          to control who can administer your custom app, who can write code for
          the commands, and who can run the slash commands.

          * You can set up [recurring tasks]($tasks) and [triggers]($triggers)
          that run commands without user input.

          * You can create encrypted parameter values, called
          [secrets]($secrets), which keep sensitive information from being
          viewed by users or being stored in Slack’s history.

          * You can import and export [command sets]($command-sets) to either
          use someone else’s code or share your own.


          ### Security


          There's nothing you need to do to secure your app. The signatures of
          incoming requests from Slack users issuing Slack commands are verified
          to ensure they are coming from Slack. See [Security]($security).
        title: Slack apps with Nimbella Commander

      Slack allows the use of custom Slack apps, which are accessed in Slack by
      means of [Slash
      Commands](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/slash-commands). When a user
      types a specific slash command like `/times`, it sends a message to a
      public URL. The request includes the command and any additional text
      following the command. Slack calls the public URL a Request URL. Custom
      Slack apps and slash commands are created using Slack's web interface at
      [api.slack.com](https://api.slack.com/) and linked to your custom code by
      means of the Request URL.

      Check out the Commander [Overview](/docs/commander/slack/overview) and
      then use the [Quickstart](/docs/commander/slack/quickstart) to get
      started. Then follow this Developer Guide to understand where to go from
      there. Once you’re proficient, you’ll be able to look up commands in the
      [Commander Reference Guide](/docs/commander/slack/reference) if you need a
      quick reminder.

          Commander `/nc`  slash commands rely on the concept of a current app.
          If you are just creating commands that run with `/nc` itself, you only
          have one app you are working with, the “nc” app. So, if you are just
          developing commands that run with the `/nc` prefix, your current app
          will always be “nc”.


          If you create a custom Slack app and connect that custom Slack app to
          Commander with the [app_add](/docs/commander/slack/reference#app_add)
          command, that app will become your “current app”. If you have multiple
          apps in your workspace, you can use the
          [app_current](/docs/commander/slack/reference#app_current) command to
          verify which app is being treated as the current app or make another
          app the current one.


          **Show the current app:**


          > ##### /nc app_current

          >

          > ###### Your current app is devops


          Switch to the accounting app: 


          > ##### /nc app_current accounting
        title: The current app
      - body: >-
          Commands support a variety of parameter definitions and Commander
          automatically parses parameters so they can be accessed easily in your
          source code. 


          When you create a command, you specify the parameters the command
          takes by enclosing parameter names in angle brackets. For example, the
          following
          [command_create](/docs/commander/slack/reference#command_create)
          command creates a command for your custom app that will take two
          parameters:


          > ##### /nc command_create add_host <hostname> <ip_addr>


          In the code for the command, you can access the command's parameters
          by name using params:


          ```

          if (params.hostname == 'a.nimbella.com') {

          ```


          But also, the default generated command source code creates local
          variables as a convenience:


          ```
           const {
              Hostname,
              Ip_addr
            } = params;
          ```


          This means you can access the parameters by name in a function without
          params:


          ```

          if (hostname == 'a.nimbella.com') {

          ```


          When a user runs this command in Slack, they add parameter values as
          in the following example (assuming the command prefix for the custom
          app is `/devops`):


          > ##### /devops add_host a.com 100.200.3.4


          If you’re working on a command and discover you want to change the
          command's parameters, you can change them with the command_params
          command. For example, if you wanted to add a TTL parameter to the
          add_host command you created above:


          > ##### /nc command_params add_host <hostname> <ip_addr> <ttl>


          **Note:** If you use /nc command_params to create new parameters, the
          command source code is not regenerated, so to access those parameters
          directly by name without using `params`, you'll need to add them to
          the list of local variables in the code first.


          ### Parameter values with white space


          When a command is run in your custom app, parameter values that
          include white space should be enclosed in a pair of either double or
          single quotes. For example, if you have a `print` command with a
          `<msg>` parameter, the value could be:


          > ##### /devops print "This parameter has multiple words"


          This command passes the value `This parameter has multiple words` to
          the command source. If you want to pass a parameter value that
          includes the double quotes, use single quotes to enclose the string,
          such as: 


          > ##### /devops print ‘“Life is what happens when you're busy making
          other plans.” - John Lennon’


          **Note:** On Apple computers (and potentially others), double quotes
          appear entered as either Unicode left or right double quotes. If the
          string starts with a Unicode left quote, a Unicode right quote will be
          expected to end it.


          ### Optional command parameter


          A list of parameters can end with one optional parameter in square
          brackets, such as the `[<ttl>]` parameter in this example:


          > ##### /nc command_create add_host <hostname> <ip_addr> \[<ttl>]


          This command can be run with either the first two parameters or all
          three, so either of these commands is valid:


          > ##### /devops add_host a.nimbella.com 1.2.3.4

          >

          > ##### /devops add_host a.nimbella.com 1.2.3.4 300


          ### Parameter options


          The parameter definition for a command can also include options.
          Options are preceded with a hyphen (-). Options can be either be flags
          or named options. Here's an example that contains a flag option
          `-detail` and a named option `-ttl` with value `ttl_value`:


          > ##### /nc command_create add_host <hostname> <ip_addr> \[-detail]
          \[-ttl <ttl_value>]


          In the source code for the command, you can check to see if a flag
          option is present either by using the params variable:


          ```

          if (params.detail) {

          ```


          or by its name alone, because the default generated code creates a
          local variable with the name of the option:


          ```

          if (detail) {

          ```


          Similarly, you can check if a named option exists by its name alone
          and check its value using the name of the value:


          ```

          if (ttl && ttl_value == 30) {

          ```


          The `add_host` command created above with the `-detail` and `-ttl`
          options can be run in any of the following ways:


          > ##### /devops add_host a.com 1.2.3.4

          >

          > ##### /devops add_host a.com 1.2.3.4 -detail

          >

          > ##### /devops add_host a.com 1.2.3.4 -ttl 90 -detail


          **Note:**


          * Options may not be used when an optional command parameter is
          present.

          * When options are specified, they must be specified at the end of the
          parameter definition.


          ### Variable number of arguments


          Command parameter definitions support `varargs`, a variable number of
          arguments. A parameter definition for a command with `varargs` ends
          with the ellipsis notation (…). The following example  specifies that
          the `add_host` command can take any number of parameters:


          > ##### /nc command_create add_host ...


          When `varargs` is used, you must code the command parameters to be
          parsed. In the command source code, the text of the full command,
          including the command prefix and all parameters, is available in
          `commandText`:


          ```

          let parts = commandText.split(" ");

          let cmdPrefix = parts[0];

          let cmd = parts[1];

          ```


          **Note:** If you use `varargs`, your parameter definition cannot
          include any [optional command
          parameters]($h3-optional-command-parameter) or [parameter
          options]($h3-parameter-options).


          ### Slack Encodings


          Slack automatically encodes certain input values. For example, if you
          type this command into Slack:


          `/nc route53_add www.example.com 1.2.3.4`


          Slack will see the `www.example.com` parameter and since it looks like
          a hostname, it automatically encodes `www.example.com` as a clickable
          link in the Slack interface.


          Additionally, it encodes the value when sent as a parameter to the
          function. If a user typed the command above, the route53_add function
          would see this value as the first parameter:


          `https://www.example.com|www.example.com`


          instead of just `www.example.com`.


          Slack also isn't entirely consistent when encoding values. For
          example, if you type a full URI such as `https://www.example.com` in
          Slack, it will encode it as just `<https://www.example.com>` which is
          the parameter the function receives.


          A convenient way to extract the URI from an encoded parameter is to
          match the parameter string against the following regex:
          `^<?([^|>]*)[|\w]*>?$`. This will tolerate the brackets `<>` that wrap
          the URI, and will ignore all text after `|` if it's present. When the
          string matches, the first regex group contains the decoded URI.


          Slack also automatically decodes values in the above format. For
          example, if you output the value in the brackets above to print in
          Slack,


          Slack will just display `www.example.com` and it will be a clickable
          link that will direct to `https://www.example.com`.
        title: Command Parameters
    body: >
      The Nimbella Commander app for Slack lets you control nearly all of the
      administrative functions for your custom app directly in the Slack
      interface by running slash commands with the command prefix `/nc`.  The
      entire set of Commander commands is listed in [the Reference
      Guide](/docs/commander/slack/reference). This Developer Guide also
      contains many examples of these commands, grouped by administrative
      function.

        body: >-
          Assuming you’ll have a number of apps with various slash commands, it
          can get difficult to keep them all straight, and Slack doesn’t have a
          formal namespace built into their commands. We’ll create a slash
          command in the DevOps app that will serve as the command prefix for
          all the commands that we create for that app.


          1. On the **Basic Information** page, click **Slash Commands**.

        body: >-
          We’ll use the Commander app’s `/nc` command to add our DevOps app to
          Commander.


          First, let’s talk about the syntax of the Nimbella Commander `app_add`
          command that’s used to add an app to Commander:


          > ##### /nc app_add <app-name> <command-prefix>


          The parameters in this command are:


          * `<app-name>`
            This will be the lower-case version of our app name, in this case devops
          * `<command-prefix>`
            The command prefix that we created in the last task. In this case, /devops.

          To connect the DevOps app to Commander:


          1. In Slack, run the following command:
             > ##### /nc app_add devops /devops

             You should see a Commander response that looks something like this:

             > ###### The devops app has been added. Please attach this Request URL to the   /devops command in Slack: https://apigcp.nimbella.io/api/v1/web/just-an-example-1234-5678/app_000/router

          2. Copy the URL that appears in the response.

          3. Go to https://api.slack.com/apps.

          4. In the **App Name** list, select the DevOps app.

            ![Connect 1](/images/uploads/connect1.png)

          5. Click **Add features and functionality**.

            ![Connect 2](/images/uploads/connect2.png)

          6. In the **Features** section in the left sidebar, click **Slash
          Commands**.

            ![Connect 3](/images/uploads/connect3.png)

          7. Click the **Edit icon** to the right of the `/devops` command.

            ![Connect 4](/images/uploads/connect4.png)

          8. Replace the **Request URL** with the one that you copied.

            ![Connect 5](/images/uploads/connect5.png)

          9. Click **Save**.


          The`/devops` slash command (which will serve as the command prefix) is
          now connected to Commander. From now on, you’ll use Commander’s `/nc`
          slash commands to create commands for the DevOps app, as we’ll do in
          the next section.
        title: Connect the App to Commander
      - anchor: Create a Print Command
        body: >-
          Now we’re ready to create our first command in our DevOps app. We’ll
          use Commander right in Slack to create a `print` command, with a
          parameter that we can then use for various types of notifications in
          our DevOps app. We’ll use this command in our GitHub example in the
          Triggers section to notify us that something has changed in our GitHub
          repository.


          1. In Slack, enter the following slash command exactly as it appears
          here, including the angle  brackets:
             > ##### /nc command_create print <msg>

               You’ll see a response similar to the following:

             > ###### Created command print <msg>, edit the code
          2. Click the link to edit the Commander code for the command.

          3. Find this line in the source code:
             ```
             "This is a default response for a newly created command with text: " + commandText
             ```
             Change the line to this:
             ```
             text: msg
             ```
          4. Click **Save**.

          5. In Slack, test the command by entering the command prefix
          (`devops`), followed by the command (`print`), followed by a text
          string for the `msg` parameter
             > ##### /devops print Howdy!

             If your `print` message has more than one word, surround it with single or double quotes or else you’ll get a response that a parameter was not found.
             You should see the Slack response shown in this screenshot, coming from your custom app and displaying the print message.
              ![Howdy](/images/uploads/print-command-howdy.png)

          Note that we created the command with an`/nc` slash command, but we
          ran the command in in our DevOps app with our `/devops` command
          prefix.

      Now we’ll create a custom Slack app with its own command prefix, which
      involves the following tasks:


      1. [Create a Slack app]($create-a-slack-app) for the DevOps team.
         The app could eventually contain a number of slash commands to accomplish tasks that DevOps normally performs.
      2. [Create a slash command]($create-a--devops-slash-command) called
      /devops.
         We’ll create a slash command in the DevOps app that will serve as a command prefix when you run commands in Slack. 
      3. [Install the app]($install-the-app) into Slack.

      4. [Connect the app to Commander]($connect-the-app).

      5. [Create a print command]($create-a-print-command) that can be used for
      various notifications.

      6. [List all apps] ($list-all-apps) connected to Commander.  
       
    title: Create/manage custom apps
  - anchor-item:
      - body: >-
          If your command source code is written in JavaScript and your command
          requires additional npm (Node Package Manager) packages to run, you
          can install them in your JavaScript source code with this function,
          which accepts an array of npm packages to install:


          ```

          async function install(pkgs) {
            pkgs = pkgs.join(' ');
            return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
              const { exec } = require('child_process');
              exec(`npm install ${pkgs}`, (err, stdout, stderr) => {
                if (err) reject(err);
                else resolve();
              });
            });
          }

          ```


          The following example shows the `install()` function being used to
          install two npm packages:


          ```

          let packages = [ 'read-installed', 'chalk' ];

          await install(packages);

          ```


          After installing the npm packages, they can be used as they normally
          would with `require()`. This example shows the read-installed package
          being used:


          ```

          var readInstalled = require('read-installed');

          readInstalled("/", { depth: 0, dev: true }, function(err, map) { … })

          ```


          **Note:** The installation of npm packages takes a little time, so
          commands that install packages will start up slower than those that do
          not.


          To speed up subsequent runs of a command function that installs
          packages, the package references returned from the `require()`
          statement can be moved into global variables in the command source
          code and the packages are only loaded if those values are undefined.
          This method will cause the packages to be installed the first time the
          command is executed. Note that they do not need to be installed if the
          same execution environment is used again by the underling serverless
          platform. When serverless function environments are reused in a
          serverless platform, the globals can maintain their previous values.


          For example, if the `readInstalled` variable above was global, the
          code could look like this:


          ```

          var readInstalled;

          function _command(...) {
            if (!readInstalled) {
              let packages = [ 'read-installed', 'chalk' ];
              await install(packages);
              readInstalled = require('read-installed');
            }
          }

          ```


          The first time the code is executed, `readInstalled` is undefined and
          the packages loaded. If the environment is reused later by the
          underlying serverless platform, the `readInstalled` value can be used
          without installing the packages.
        title: Add npm packages for a command
    body: >-
      **Create a command for your custom app**


      Use [command_create](/docs/commander/slack/reference#command_create) to
      create custom slash commands for the current app. Put
      [parameters]($command-parameters) to be created in angle brackets.


      * Create an `add_host` command with parameters for hostname and IP
      address:
        > ##### /nc command_create add_host <hostname> <ip_addr>

       Outputs a link to the Nimbella Cloud command source code, which you edit. 

      If you lose this link or want to go back to it later, use the
      [command_code](/docs/commander/slack/reference#command_code) command.


      See the tutorial in the [Quickstart
      Guide](/docs/commander/slack/quickstart) for a detailed example of
      creating the command in Slack and following the link to add code.


      **Retrieve the source code link for a command**


      Use [command_code](/docs/commander/slack/reference#command_code) to
      retrieve the link to the source code for a command you’ve already created.
      A link is generated that will work for 24 hours.


      * Retrieve the code link for the `add_host` command:
        > ##### /nc command_code add_host

      **List all commands in the current app**


      Use [command_list](/docs/commander/slack/reference#command_list). 


      * List all of the commands in the current app:
        > ##### /nc command_list

      **Info about a command**


      Use [command_info](/docs/commander/slack/reference#command_info) to get
      the following information about an individual command:


      * When it was created

      * Who created it

      * When the source was last modified

      * Who modified the source


      This information appears in the command output.


      * Get information about the `add_host` command:
        > ##### /nc command_info add_host

      **View or set a command’s short description**


      Commands have a short description that describes what they are or what
      they do. Use [command_desc](/docs/commander/slack/reference#command_desc)
      to view or create the short description. If you’re adding a description
      that has white space, enclose the value in single or double quotes.


      * View the short description of the `add_host` command:
        > ##### /nc command_desc add_host
      * Set the short description of the `add_host` command:
        > ##### /nc command_desc add_host "Adds a hostname"

      **Call a webhook for a command**


      Commander automatically executes the source code for a command when it is
      run in Slack. If you don't want the command to automatically run its
      source code, you can set it to call a webhook instead with
      [command_webhook](/docs/commander/slack/reference#command_webhook). When a
      webhook is set up for a command, the associated webhook URL will be
      contacted and its result returned to Slack instead of running the
      command's source code.


      **Tip:** A command webhook can be useful when developing code. Use a
      webhook relay to proxy a command to your local development machine to
      develop and debug the command source code locally. After setting up a
      webhook relay to your local machine, you can run a Node server locally
      that will execute the command when it is run in Slack.


      * Set up a webhook with the URL of the webhook relay to contact when the
      `add_host` command is run:
        > ##### /nc command_webhook add_host https://m.mywebhookrelay09.com/F07173

      You can revert to executing the source code for the command by first
      clearing the webhook, then using retrieve the link to the code editor to
      save the command code.


      * Turn off the `add_host` command webhook:
        > ##### /nc command_webhook add_host clear
      * Retrieve the link to the code editor to save the `add_host` source code
      and return to running the command normally:
        > ##### /nc command_code add_host

      If you need to, you can use
      [command_log](/docs/commander/slack/reference#command_log) to get the log
      history of the command to see who ran the command at what times and also
      the time it took the command to execute. See the [Logs]($logs) section for
      more information.


      * Get the log history of the add_host command:
        > ##### /nc command_log add_host

      **Delete a command**


      Use [command_delete](/docs/commander/slack/reference#command_delete) plus
      the command name.


      * Delete the `add_host` command:
        > ##### /nc command_delete add_host

          For examples of assigning these user roles, see [Commands to manage
          users and user groups]($commands-to-manage-users-and-user-groups).


          ### Admin


          In Commander, every custom Slack app starts with one administrative
          user: the Slack user who initially adds the custom app to Commander.
          It’s up to that admin to assign other Slack users as admins for that
          app. Admins in turn can assign users as coders for specific commands
          in the app and as runners of specific commands in the app. 


          Admins can also create user groups to make it easier to set coder and
          runner roles for multiple users. See the command examples below.


          Admins have no restrictions on what they can do when it comes to an
          app. Only admin users can create commands, assign roles to other
          users, and perform other administrative tasks. Admins can do anything
          that coders and runners can do.


          ### Coder


          The coder role is associated with specific commands. A Slack user with
          a coder role for a command is allowed to edit the source code for the
          command and also run the command. App admins manage the list of coders
          for commands. Coders are automatically runners for the commands they
          can edit.


          ### Runner


          The runner role is associated with specific commands ii the custom
          app. A Slack user with a runner role for a command is allowed to run
          that command. They cannot run commands in the Commander app.
        title: About user roles
      - body: >-
          Instead of assigning Coder and Runner roles to individual users,
          admins can combine users into user groups to make it easier to set
          coder and runner roles for multiple users. The entire user group can
          then be added or removed as coders or runners for a command.
        title: About user groups
      - body: >-
          ### Manage admin users


          Use the [app_admins](/docs/commander/slack/reference#app_admins)
          command to list, add, or remove Slack users as admins for the current
          app. A plus (+) in front of a user name adds the user to the list and
          a minus (-) removes a user from the list. 


          **Note:** There must be a space between the plus (+) and minus (-)
          signs and the user to be added or removed as admins for the current
          app. 


          * **List the users who are admins for the current app:**
            > ##### /nc app_admins
            >
            > ###### devops admins: Sam, Jill
          * **Add Bill and Mary and remove Larry as admins for the current
          app:**
            > ##### /nc app_admins + @Bill + @Mary - @Larry

          ### Manage coder users


          Use [command_coders](/docs/commander/slack/reference#command_coders)
          to list, add, or remove users as coders for particular commands.


          * **View the current list of coders for the add_host  command:**
            > ##### /nc command_coders add_host
          * **Add Jim and Bob and remove John as coders for the print command:**
            > ##### /nc command_coders print + @Jim + @Bob - @John

          ### Manage users who run commands


          Use [command_runners](/docs/commander/slack/reference#command_runners)
          to list, add, or remove users as runners for particular custom
          commands.


          * **Add Joe and Sue and remove John as runners for the print
          command:**
            > ##### /nc command_runners print + @Joe + @Sue - @John

          ### Allow anyone to run a custom command


          There is a special user group that always exists called `anyone`,
          which includes every Slack user. If you want to allow a command to be
          run by `anyone`, you can add the anyone group to the list of command 
          runners:


          * **Let anyone run the print command: **
            > ##### /nc command_runners print + anyone

          ### Create user groups


          Use [group_create](/docs/commander/slack/reference#group_create) to
          create a user group.


          * **Create a user group called devgroup1:**
            > ##### /nc group_create devgroup1

          ### List, add, or remove members of a user group


          Use the [group_members](/docs/commander/slack/reference#group_members)
          command.


          * **Add Sue to devgroup1:**
            > ##### /nc group_members devgroup1 + @Sue
          * **Add Jim, Bob, and John and remove Sue from devgroup1:**
            > ##### /nc group_members devgroup1 + @Jim + @Bob + John - @Sue
          * **List the members of devgroup1:**
            > ##### /nc group_members devgroup1
            >
            > ###### devgroup1 members: Jim, Bob, John

          ### List all user groups


          Use the [group_list
          ](/docs/commander/slack/reference#group_list)command.


          * **List all user groups for the current app.**
            > ##### /nc group_list
            >
            > ###### devgroup1

          ### Delete a user group


          Use the [group_delete](/docs/commander/slack/reference#group_delete)
          command to delete a user group. Only the named group of users is
          deleted, the command does not affect the Slack users themselves in any
          way.


          * **Delete the user group devgroup1:**
            > ##### /nc group_delete devgroup1

          ### Add a user group to a command


          We gave examples of using
          [command_coders](/docs/commander/slack/reference#command_coders) and
          [command_runners](/docs/commander/slack/reference#command_runners) to
          add users as coders and runners respectively. Here are two examples of
          adding a user group instead.


          * **Add the user group devgroup1 as coders for the print command:**

            > ##### /nc command_coders print + devgroup1

          * **Add the user group bookkeeping as runners for the bills command:**

            > ##### /nc command_runners bills + bookkeeping

          * List this user’s secret key-value pairs and all global secret
          key-value pairs:

            > ##### /nc secret_list

            The output is a list of keys with their encrypted values. Only the beginning and end of the encrypted values are shown for each secret because the encrypted values can get rather long.
        title: View an app’s secret key-value pairs

          Use the [secret_delete](/docs/commander/slack/reference#secret_delete)
          command in Slack with the name of the secret key.

             > ##### /nc secret_delete gc_key
        title: Delete a secret
      - body: >-
          Once added to your app, decrypted secret values can be accessed in
          source code using the `secrets` input parameter. 


          * Example code that accesses a secret value with the key
          `mySecretApiKey`:
            ```
            async function my_command(params, text, secrets = {}) {
              if (!secrets.mySecretApiKey) {
                return { text: "you need a mySecretApiKey secret to run this command" };
              }
              .. connect to API using secrets.mySecretApiKey ..
            }
            ```
          * Look in the command source code under the secrets input parameter.
          For example:
            ```
            awsConnection = createAwsConnection(secrets.awsKey);
            gwpConnection = createGwpConnection(secrets.gwpKey);
            …
            ```
        title: Access the decrypted value of a secret in your command code
    body: >-
      Users in Commander can create secrets, which are key-value pairs where the
      value is encrypted. The key is an arbitrary name, and the value represents
      an input parameter that should not be visible, such as an API key or
      password. Secret values appear as command function input parameters with
      the value automatically decrypted as it is passed to the command
      function’s source code.


      When a user creates and adds secrets, the secret key/values are passed to
      every command function in the app that specific user runs. Administrator
      users of a Commander app can create global secrets. Global secrets are
      passed as input parameters to every command run by every user.


      Secrets are specific to a Commander app. One Commander app can't see
      another Commander app's secrets.


      Commander has a Secret Creator web user interface (UI) where users create
      key-value pairs. After creating a secret, the user should copy the
      “secret_add” command for each secret and paste it into Slack. That way,
      unencrypted secret values are stored outside of your app's source code and
      never appear in plain text in Slack.


      Each Slack app contains a unique encryption key to encrypt the values for
      all key-value pairs. Secrets encrypted for one app can't be decrypted by
      any other app. The encrypted values are stored in a Commander app using
      AES-256-bit symmetric encryption. 


      Here’s an overview of how secrets are created, with detailed procedures
      below:


      * Use the `secret_create` command in Slack, which outputs a link to the
      Secret Creator.

      * Create the key-value name pairs in the Secret Creator and click a button
      to encrypt the values.
        The Secret Creator outputs a `secret_add` command for each key-value pair you’ve created.
      * Copy and paste the `secret_add` commands into Slack to add them to your
      app.


      Note: By default, the global checkbox is checked for each secret key/value
      pair when an administor user runs the `secret_create` command. Uncheck the
      box if you are an administrator who wants to create a secret that is
      specific to you.


      Here are examples of procedures related to secrets.


      **Create secret key-value pairs and add them to your app:**


      1. Enter the following command into Slack:

        > ##### /nc secret_create
        >
        > ###### click here to access the Secret Creator

      2. In the Secret Creator UI, add a set of name-value pairs, then click
      **Make Secrets**. 
         The Secret Creator outputs a list of secret_add commands, as in this example:

        > ##### /nc secret_add awsKey NFa\_305fe79...c21e4285385f17\_
        >
        > ##### /nc secret_add gwpKey NFa\_5c67f7b...85e915084650f6\_

      3. Copy and paste each
      [secret_add](/docs/commander/slack/reference#secret_add) command from the
      Secret Creator output into Slack to add the encrypted key-value pairs to
      your current app.

      Commander has three log commands to view logs for an app, command, or user
      respectively:


      * [app_log](/docs/commander/slack/reference#app_log)

      * [command_log](/docs/commander/slack/reference#command_log)

      * [user_log](/docs/commander/slack/reference#user_log)


      The log commands are straightforward and currently only have the
      functionality to display the logs. Here are examples of each being used:


      * Show the log for the [current app]($the-current-app):
        > ##### /nc app_log

         Output example:

        > ###### 343. user_log @Joe Ran by @Joe 10/18/2019, 12:19:13 AM (App: /devops)
        
        > ###### 342. command_code print Ran by @Joe 10/17/2019, 11:26:08 PM (App: /devops)
      * Show the log for the `add_host` command:
        > ##### /nc command_log print

         Output example:

        > ###### 8. print Ran by @Joe 10/17/2019, 6:49:34 PM Execution time 125ms with status 200 (App: /devops)
        >
        > ###### 7. print Ran by @Joe 10/17/2019, 1:30:53 PM Execution time 122ms with status 200 (App: /devops)
      * Show the log for user `@Sam`:
        > ##### /nc user_log @Sam

         Output example:

      **Tip:** Every log has a line number. To go back in history, log commands
      support a `-from` option with a line number parameter, for example:


      > ##### /nc app_log -from 90

      >

      > ##### /nc command_log add_host -from 210

      >

      > ##### /nc user_log @Rick -from 300


      More advanced features, such as searching logs and allowing them to be
      exported will be supported in future releases.

          In Commander, a channel is associated with an incoming webhook that
          can post into that channel. To allow your app to post in a channel,
          you must first create an incoming webhook for that channel in a custom
          Slack app, then add it to Commander using the
          [channel_add](/docs/commander/slack/reference#channel_add) command.
          You can use this command with a public, private or locked channel.
          When you add a channel, a message is posted into that channel to let
          you know the channel was added to Commander.


          Here’s how to create a channel and add it to Commander. In this
          example, let’s add a channel called `#devops-output` to the custom
          DevOps app that was created in the [Quickstart
          Guide](/docs/commander/slack/quickstart). 


          **To create a channel in your custom Slack app:**


          1. If you want to use a channel other than one that already exists in
          Slack, create it.
             In this example, we created a `#devops-output` channel.
          2. Go to https://api.slack.com/apps.

          3. Select the DevOps app.

          4. Click** Add features and functionality**.

          5. Click** Incoming Webhooks**.

          6. Enable **Incoming Webhooks**.

          7. Click **Add New Webhook to Workspace**.

          8. Select the channel you want the task to output to and click
          **Allow**.

          9. Click **Copy** for the webhook URL you just created.

          10. In Slack, run the following command, substituting the values for
          channel name and webhook URL:


          > ##### /nc channel_add #devops-output <webhook URL>

            Replace <webhook URL> by pasting in the webhook URL that you copied in the previous step.

            Example:

          > ##### /nc channel_add #devops-output
          https://hooks.slack.com/services/BAHCHA1928/BGHA018481/6jaKjsAHhADKJAd


          **Note:** After you add the channel, you need to set the channel for
          your task or trigger. See the [Tasks]($tasks) and
          [Triggers]($triggers) sections for example commands.
        title: Create/add a channel
      - body: |-
          Use the channel_list command.

          * To list all channels added to the [current app]($the-current-app):
            > ##### /nc channel_list
        title: List channels added to your app
      - body: >-
          Use the
          [channel_delete](/docs/commander/slack/reference#channel_delete)
          command with the channel name as a parameter. 


          * Delete the `#devops-output` channel from Commander:
            > ##### /nc channel_delete #devops-output

          **Note:** This command does not delete the channel's incoming webhook
          from Slack. To delete the channel's incoming webhook, delete it from
          Slack using [api.slack.com](https://api.slack.com/).
        title: Delete a channel
    body: >-
      By default, Slack apps that use Commander can only output to Slack in
      response to a Slack command. [Tasks]($tasks), which run a command at an
      interval or rate, and [triggers]($triggers), which connect external
      webhooks to commands, aren’t run by users, so they require the ability to
      post to a Slack channel on their own. Commander includes channel commands
      that enable triggers and tasks to post in channels on their own.


      **Note:** If you aren't using tasks or triggers, you don't need to add
      channels to your app
    title: Channels
  - anchor-item:
      - body: >-
          Use the [task_create](/docs/commander/slack/reference#task_create)
          command with parameters for the task name, output channel, and the
          command to run.


          Create a task called `mytask`, output to the `#general` channel, and
          run the `print` command with the parameter “`Hello World`”:


          > ##### /nc task_create mytask #general print "Hello World"
        title: Create a task
      - body: >-
          Use [task_rate](/docs/commander/slack/reference#task_rate). The
          command includes the optional parameters `<value>` and `<unit>` to set
          the rate, where `<value>` is a number and `<unit>` is one of: `minute,
          minutes, hour, hours, day or days`.


          Notes: After you set the rate, use `task_start` to start the task. If
          a task is running, it must be stopped with `task_stop` before the rate
          can be changed. 


          * View the task rate for `mytask`:
            > ##### /nc task_rate mytask
          * Set the task rate for mytask to 15 minutes:
            > ##### /nc task_rate mytask 15 minutes
          * Set the task rate for `mytask` to one day:
            > ##### /nc task_rate mytask 1 day
        title: View or set the task rate
      - body: >-
          Use task_start. You can also restart a task with this command after
          using `task_stop`.


          * Start `mytask`:

            > ##### /nc task_start mytask
        title: Start the task
      - body: >-
          Use [task_stop](/docs/commander/slack/reference#task_stop). Stopping a
          task doesn't delete it or change it, it just stops the task from
          running. You can view or set the schedule or rate of a task with the
          task_rate and task_interval commands. A task must be stopped to change
          its schedule or rate.


          * Stop `mytask`:

            > ##### /nc task_stop mytask
        title: Stop the task
      - body: >-
          Use [task_list](/docs/commander/slack/reference#task_list) to output a
          list of all tasks in the [current app]($the-current-app) and their
          states.


          * To list all tasks and their states:

            > ##### /nc task_list
        title: List all tasks
      - body: >-
          Use [task_info](/docs/commander/slack/reference#task_info) to show the
          following information about the task:


          * Name

          * Creator

          * Schedule or rate

          * Status (stopped or running). 

          * If the task was started or stopped, the time it started running or
          when it was stopped is shown.


          This information appears in the command output.


          * Show the task information for `mytask`:

            > ##### /nc task_info
        title: Get info about a task
      - body: >-
          Use [task_channel](/docs/commander/slack/reference#task_channel) to
          view or set the channel associated with a task.


          * View the channel used for `mytask`:

            > ##### /nc task_channel mytask

          If you’re setting or changing the task channel, be sure that the
          channel has been [created in your Slack app and added to
          Commander]($create-add-a-channel).


          * Set or change the task output channel for `mytask` to `#general`:

            > ##### /nc task_channel mytask #general
        title: View or set the channel for task
      - body: >-
          Use [task_delete](/docs/commander/slack/reference#task_delete) to
          delete a specific task.


          * Delete `mytask`:

            > ##### /nc task_delete mytask
        title: Delete a task
    body: >-
      Tasks run commands at scheduled times or at a given rate. 


      There are several commands to create and manage tasks. After creating a
      task, you can set its schedule or interval with
      [task_schedule](/docs/commander/slack/reference#task_schedule) or
      [task_rate](/docs/commander/slack/reference#task_rate) and then start the
      task running with
      [task_start](/docs/commander/slack/reference#task_start).
    title: Tasks
  - anchor-item:
      - anchor: 'Example: Create a trigger for a GitHub webhook'
        body: >-
          As an example, you might want to set up a webhook for Github push
          events where a Github push (a transfer of commits to a repository)
          causes a command to be run to notify users in a Slack channel that a
          push took place. Here’s the sequence of tasks to set this up, with
          detailed instructions following:


          1. Choose which Slack output channel you want to use (add a channel to
          Commander if you haven’t already)  and which command to trigger. In
          this case, we’ll use the existing #general channel and the print
          command that was in the [Quickstart Guide
          tutorial](/docs/commander/slack/quickstart#create-a-print-command)

          2. Create a trigger with an output channel and output message, using
          [trigger_create](/docs/commander/slack/reference#trigger_create). This
          command outputs an incoming URL in the Nimbella Cloud.

          3. Use this incoming URL to create an external webhook in GitHub that
          notifies the incoming URL each time there’s a push in the repository.


          Github has documentation about their webhooks on
          [developer.github.com](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/), but
          here are basic instructions:


          **To set up a trigger for a GitHub webhook to print Slack
          notifications when there’s a repository push:**


          1. In Slack, create a trigger called GHpushTrigger that writes the
          output from the `print` command to the #general channel:

            > ##### /nc trigger_create GHpushTrigger #general print “Hey there’s been a push in your GitHub repo!”
            >
            > ###### created trigger printTrigger with incoming URL https://agigcp.nimbella.com/AHC901230/nc/v1

          2. Copy the incoming URL in the response. 

          3. In GitHub, choose your repository.

          4. Click the **Settings** tab.

          5. Click **Webhooks** in the left sidebar.

          6. Click **Add Webhook**.

          7. In the **Payload URL** field, paste the incoming URL of the trigger
          you created.

          8. Select **application/json** as the **Content type**.

          9. Select **Just the push event**.

          10. Make sure the **Active** checkbox is selected and click **Save
          webhook**.


          Now any Github push event in the GitHub repository will cause the
          print command to be run and the output sent to the **\#general**
          channel. 


          ### Access GitHub event information


          When Github sends an event using a webhook, it puts information about
          the event in an "`X-Github-Event`" HTTP header. The `params.__trigger`
          variable in your command has all the HTTP headers and parameters of
          the incoming request, so you can access the Github event information
          with `params.__trigger.X-Github-Event`:


          ```

          JSON.stringify(params.__trigger.X-Github-Event, null, 2)

          ```
        title: 'Example: Create a trigger for a GitHub webhook with trigger_create'
      - body: >-
          ### Disable a trigger


          Use
          [trigger_disable](/docs/commander/slack/reference#trigger_disable).
          Disabling a trigger doesn't delete it or change it, it just stops the
          task from running the command.


          * Disable the `GHpushTrigger` trigger:
            > ##### /nc trigger_disable GHpushTrigger

          ### Re-enable a trigger


          The `trigger_create` command automatically enables the trigger, but if
          you run the `trigger_disable` command, you can re-enable the disabled
          trigger using
          [trigger_enable](/docs/commander/slack/reference#trigger_enable).


          * Re-enable `GHpushTrigger`:
            > ##### /nc trigger_enable GHpushTrigger

          ### Info about a trigger


          The [trigger_info](/docs/commander/slack/reference#trigger_info)
          command shows information about a trigger. 


          ### List all triggers


          Use the [trigger_list](/docs/commander/slack/reference#trigger_list)
          command to get a list of all the triggers in the [current
          app]($the-current-app). 


          * List all triggers in the current app:
            > ##### /nc trigger_list

          ### View/set the channel associated with a trigger:


          Use
          [trigger_channel](/docs/commander/slack/reference#trigger_channel).


          * View the channel associated with `GHpushTrigger`:
            > ##### /nc trigger_channel GHpushTrigger
          * Set the channel associated with `GHpushTrigger`:
            > ##### /nc trigger_channel GHpushTrigger #general

          ### Delete a trigger


          Use the
          [trigger_delete](/docs/commander/slack/reference#trigger_delete)
          command. 


          **Note:** If you delete a trigger, you should first delete the
          external webhook that is calling it so you don't end up with a webhook
          that continues to call an endpoint that doesn't exist.


          * Delete the `GHpushTrigger` trigger:
            > ##### /nc trigger_delete GHpushTrigger
        title: Other commands for managing triggers
    body: >-
      Triggers allow an external webhook to trigger execution of a command and
      output the results to a Slack channel. When a trigger is created, an
      incoming webhook URL is created for the trigger that you have set an
      external webhook to call when an event takes place.


      Like tasks, triggers aren't run by users, so they need a way to output to
      a Slack channel that you’ve [created and added to your
      app]($create-add-a-channel).
    title: Triggers
  - anchor-item:
      - body: >-
          Nimbella maintains links to commonly used command sets that can be
          installed using single-word names. For example, there is a `billing`
          command set that contains billing commands for common cloud services,
          such as Amazon Web Services. See the [Example command sets
          section]($example-command-sets) for a list of the example command sets
          available.


          **Note: **Many of the commands in the `billing` command set require
          API keys to allow the command source to obtain billing information
          from the various cloud providers. For example, to use the `awsbill`
          command, you must create secrets for `awsCostExplorerAccessKeyId`,
          `awsCostExplorerSecretAccessKeyId`, and `awsCostExplorerRegion`. See
          the [Secrets]($secrets) section for how to access information and API
          keys that need to be added to run the commands that require them. The
          various commands will output what API keys are required when they are
          run and what secrets are missing that they need.


          ### Install a command set


          * Install the `billing` command set in the [current
          app]($the-current-app), along with the  source for the commands:

            > ##### /nc csm_install billing

          Output: List of commands installed.


          Use [csm_commands](/docs/commander/slack/reference#csm_commands) at
          any time to see the list of commands that were installed in this
          command set:


          * List the commands installed with the `billing` command set:

            > ##### /nc csm_commands billing

          Customize and edit the source code of any of the installed commands
          using [command_code](/docs/commander/slack/reference#command_code) to
          get a link to edit the command's source code. 


          * Retrieve a link to the `awsbill` command’s source code:

            > ##### /nc command_code awsbill
        title: 'Example 1: Install the Nimbella billing command set'
      - body: >-
          The Github repository has a commands.yaml file in its root directory
          that contains the OpenCSI YAML definition of the command set. You can
          publish your own command set for others to use by putting a
          commands.yaml file for the command set into a GitHub repository. The
          commands.yaml file contains the definition of each command along with
          links to the source code for each command. 


          Anyone Installing this command set from Github would use the following
          command:


          > ##### /nc csm_install github:<name>/<project>
        title: 'Example 2: Install a command set from a GitHub repository'
      - body: >-
          A third way to install a command set from an external location is by
          specifying the full URL of the command set YAML definition. 


          * Install a command set YAML from the URL
          https://a.b.com/commands.yaml:

            > ##### /nc csm_install https://a.b.com/commands.yaml
        title: 'Example 3: Install a command set from a URL'
      - body: >-
          ### Update an externally loaded command set


          If an externally loaded command set is updated, you can update the
          source for all the commands from the source location with
          [csm_update](/docs/commander/slack/reference#csm_update).


          * Update the `billing` command set:

            > ##### /nc csm_update billing

          **Notes:** 


          * Any changes you made to the source code of the commands in the set
          are overwritten by running `csm_update`. 

          * Github runs a caching service in front of the Github web site, so if
          a command set is updated on Github an update may not immediately
          reflect the changes to the command set.


          ### List all the command sets and commands in each command set


          The [csm_list](/docs/commander/slack/reference#csm_list) command
          outputs all the command sets in the [current app]($the-current-app)
          and also all the commands in each command set. There are no
          parameters.


          * List all command sets and all commands in each set in the current
          app:

            > ##### /nc csm_list

            > ###### billing: awsbill, datadogbill

            The output shows there is one command set (`billing`) with two commands: `awsbill` and `datadogbill`

          ### List the commands in a specified command set


          Use [csm_commands](/docs/commander/slack/reference#csm_commands) to
          see the list of commands included in one command set:


          * List the commands installed with the `billing` command set:

            > ##### /nc csm_commands billing

          ### Show information about a command set


          The [csm_info](/docs/commander/slack/reference#csm_info) command
          provides the following information for a specified command set that
          was loaded with `csm_install`:


          * Name of the command set

          * URL location

          * Version number

          * Description of the command set


          **Note:** This command doesn’t work with command sets created with
          `csm_create`. 


          ### Uninstall a command set


          Use [csm_uninstall](/docs/commander/slack/reference#csm_uninstall) to
          uninstall a command set. 


          **Note:** This command also deletes all the source code for the
          commands in the set, even if the source has been modified. To prevent
          this, delete the command set instead.


          * Uninstall the `billing` command set:

            > ##### /nc csm_uninstall billing

          ### Delete a command set


          Use [csm_delete](/docs/commander/slack/reference#csm_delete) to delete
          a named command set. Only the command set is deleted – the commands in
          the set are unaffected by this command. If you want to delete the
          commands as well, use the
          [csm_uninstall](/docs/commander/slack/reference#csm_uninstall) command
          instead.


          * Delete the billing command set from the current app:

            > ##### /nc csm_uninstall myset
        title: Commands to manage command sets
      - body: >-
          First, create a command set, then add and remove commands in a second
          step.


          ### Create a command set


          Use the [csm_create](/docs/commander/slack/reference#csm_create)
          command to create an internal command set. 


          * Create a command set called `myset`:

            > ##### /nc csm_create myset 

          ### Add and remove commands


          Use [csm_commands](/docs/commander/slack/reference#csm_commands) to
          add and remove commands from a command set. Use plus signs to add and
          minus signs to remove. Leave a space after the plus or minus sign.


          * Add the commands `mycommand1` and `mycommand2` to the `myset`
          command set:

            > ##### /nc csm_commands myset + mycommand1 + mycommand2

          The `csm_commands` command without the optional parameters lists the
          commands included in this command set.


          ### Export an OpenCSI definition of your internal command set

           The [csm_export](/docs/commander/slack/reference#csm_export) command outputs an [OpenCSI](/docs/commander/slack/opencsi) definition for a command set. You can copy that definition to an external location, such as into a commands.yaml file in a Github repository, then put in references to the source code for the commands.

          * Output an OpenCSI definition for the `myset` command set:

            > ##### /nc csm_export myset

          A large number of pre-built command sets are available. All command
          sets include source code.


          The list of command sets that can be installed with single word names
          is available here:


          https://github.com/nimbella/command-sets


          See [Example 1]($example-1-install-the-nimbella-billing-command-set)
          for how to install and view the commands in the `billing` command set.
        title: Example command sets
    body: >-
      Command sets can be used to install, manage or publish a set of commands.
      A command set contains the definition of each command in the set,
      including the command's name, parameters, and a description. A command set
      also includes the source code for each command in the set. 


      Command sets are defined by a YAML file in OpenCSI Specification format.
      The YAML file includes links to the source code for each command. Put the
      YAML file in a web-accessible location, along with the source code for
      each command. Installing the command set using the
      [csm_install](/docs/commander/slack/reference#csm_install) command brings
      in the commands and their source, so the source can be customized at the
      new location. The process is similar to installing npm  (Node Package
      Manager) packages.


      You can install publicly available command sets in several different ways,
      as shown in the following examples.

          When you add an app to Commander, an account is automatically created
          for you and tied to your Slack workspace. All apps added to the same
          Slack workspace share the same account.


          Accounts have plan information (paid/unpaid) and various limits
          associated with them. 


          * To view the account information associated with your Slack
          workspace, including the plan and limits, use
          [account_info](/docs/commander/slack/reference#account_info).

          * If you want to increase your account limits and upgrade your plan,
          use the
          [account_upgrade](/docs/commander/slack/reference#account_upgrade)
          command to start the upgrade process for your Slack workspace. This
          command outputs a web link that will take you to a web page showing
          your upgrade options and various plan costs.
        title: Manage Accounts
    body: >-
      You’ll notice when you install the Commander app in Slack, it doesn’t ask
      for permissions to read messages. Commander does not read messages in any
      channel, it is output only and only responds to slash commands connected
      to commander. All connections from Slack to Commander must be explicitly
      made by a Slack workspace administrator.


      When you install Commander, it doesn’t read any of your messages. It can’t
      create custom Slack slash commands on its own. It also doesn’t have access
      to read from any of the channels but it can post in a channel.


      For example, if you want a Commander task to post a message in a Slack
      channel, you must create an incoming webhook URL for the channel and give
      that webhook URL to Commander with the channel_add command. That isn't
      necessary for slash commands that users type into a channel. When your
      custom Slack app is in your workspace and you type custom commands, it has
      permission to post in the channel the command is run from.


      User and team identities are automatically managed by Slack. When Slack
      slash commands are executed, Commander ensures Slack is the caller using a
      shared secret key. HTTPS is used for all communications. Internally,
      Commander uses the Nimbella Cloud. In the Nimbella Cloud, each command
      function executes in an isolated container, with its environment separated
      from other containers. Apps in Commander are each separated by namespaces
      with their own authorization keys.
    title: Security
  - body: >-
      The free version of Commander has limitations in terms of commands, tasks,
      and triggers and only allows commands to be written in JavaScript.
      Upgrades are available on a Slack workspace (team) basis to give all apps
      in the workspace higher limits and enable more features. Upgrades include
      the ability to allow direct development using the Nimbella workbench.

      information.
