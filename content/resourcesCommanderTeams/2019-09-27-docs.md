      You can install directly by clicking here: [Add Commander to Microsoft
      Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/app/be4751a5-db56-4e45-bb27-397e0aa614b1)


      To complete the tutorial and create your own commands, you must have
      permission to install an app in Microsoft Teams. If you are Teams admin,
      you should have that permission. If you can't, you will need to contact
      your Teams admin to get permission to install Commander in Teams.

      Run "@commander take a tour" in any Teams channel. This will invoke
      Commander and execute "take a tour" command.


      In order to chat with Commander bot privately, go to chat, click on the
      edit button, add Commander and then type "take a tour". When interacting
      with Commander bot privately, you don't need to type @commander for every
      command.

      Let's create a command. We'll explain these steps later on.


      1. Click on the Commander bot in Chat to interact with Commander. 

      2. Create a print command

      CLASS=undefined ALT=


      CMS-COMMANDERCOMMANDS ROLE=user INDENT=1 MESSAGE=command create print


      CMS-COMMANDERCOMMANDS ROLE=admin INDENT=1 MESSAGE=Created command `print` 
      , edit the code


      3. Change the source code for the print command to print the message by
      clicking on **edit the code** link

      CLASS=w75 ALT=edit the code


      4. Run the print command you just created.
         You can click on the run print button or type run print
         > ##### run print
         >
         > ###### This is a default response for a newly created command with text: print
      5. Ask Commander to list all custom commands
         > ##### command list
      6. Show a log of the print command you created
         > ##### command log print
      7. Allow another user to run the print command. The commands for allowing
      access control to other users can only be executed in public channels. You
      will need to prefix the commands with @commander to run commands in public
      channels. (Refer: _Ways to interact with Commander_)

      Sets of commands can be installed using a command set manager (csm)
      command. 


      1. Install the dig command set 
         > ##### csm install dig
      2. Run the dig command. It is part of the dig command set you just
      installed.

      1. Using Commander in Public Channels


      CMS-INDENT INDENT=1 CONTENT=You can use Commander in Microsoft Teams in
      public channels by typing @commander and then a command. For example:


      CMS-INDENT INDENT=1 CONTENT=@commander run print


      CMS-INDENT INDENT=1 CONTENT=When you type @commander and press space, the
      @ sign should appear and "Commander" should change to a blue color. If it
      doesn't, then you likely have a channel or other name in Microsoft Teams
      that starts with the word "Commander".


      CMS-IMAGECLASS IMAGE=/images/uploads/teamscomselect.png INDENT=1
      CLASS=undefined ALT=


      CMS-INDENT INDENT=1 CONTENT=Correct use: If you use @ to direct a message
      at someone in Microsoft teams, it will automatically set the recipient if
      you type the full name of that person or bot and then press space but only
      if that name is unique. (see below)


      CMS-IMAGECLASS IMAGE=/images/uploads/teamsprint-right.png INDENT=1
      CLASS=undefined ALT=


      CMS-INDENT INDENT=1 CONTENT=Incorrect use: If you type the full word
      "@commander" and a list with more than one option is present at the end
      and you press space, Teams will not automatically select an option for you
      and the @commander will appear with the @ sign, in its original color, and
      the command you type won't end up being sent to Commander (see below)


      CMS-IMAGECLASS IMAGE=/images/uploads/teamsprint-wrong.png INDENT=1
      CLASS=undefined ALT=


      CMS-INDENT INDENT=1 CONTENT=Because of this, in a public channel, it is
      best to start typing @commander and then hit Enter and select the
      Commander bot from the list that pops up to direct a message to Commander.
      This ensures the message will be directed at Commander in any case.


      2. Privately Chatting with Commander


      CMS-INDENT INDENT=1 CONTENT=You can also message the Commander bot
      directly in Chat. When interacting with Commander bot, you don't need to
      prefix a command with @commander, you can simply type the command.


      CMS-INDENT INDENT=1 CONTENT=If you are creating a command with parameters
      in the private Commander channel, you need to press Shift-Enter to create
      the command. Just pressing Enter will not create the command with
      parameters. This is not a bug but it is Microsoft Teams behavior. This is
      not required when creating commands in pubic channels.


      3. Using Commander in other Private Channels


      CMS-INDENT INDENT=1 CONTENT=Microsoft Teams does not support communicating
      with bots in a private channel that is not the bot's channel. Because of
      this, you can't issue a Commander command in a private channel that is
      between you and someone else.
