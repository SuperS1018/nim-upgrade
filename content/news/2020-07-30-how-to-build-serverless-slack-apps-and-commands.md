excerpt: >-
  I was recently looking for articles that describe how to build custom Slack
  apps, bots, and commands. I found several informative articles that describe
  using Serverless technology for this purpose (see this, this and this for
  example). These blogs contain a lot of details, but they also cover a lot of
  steps.
