excerpt: >-
  Serverless computing made great advances in 2020 and we expect this to grow as
  technologies like cloud computing, API-first, DevOps, and open-source
  movements continue to evolve. In 2021, we can expect that there will be a
  greater adoption of serverless computing at a faster pace. Anything you want
  to do in the cloud, users will be able to accomplish with an API, creating an
  even more so interconnected world.
