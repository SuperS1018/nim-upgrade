excerpt: >-
  Developers today want to develop code and not worry about the infrastructure.
  That is exactly what the serverless computing revolution promises. But
  serverless computing is still in a nascent phase and comes with its fair share
  of complexities. Nimbella is looking to fill this gap by delivering a
  complete, integrated solution. Nimbella is a serverless cloud solution that
  leverages public cloud infrastructure. It can also be extended to on-premises
  (private) datacenters. Its cloud-agnostic nature prevents problems like vendor
  lock-in which is one of the greatest drawbacks of serverless computing
  solutions today. They’re all tied to a single cloud vendor. In this article,
  we dig deep into Nimbella’s solution to understand how it solves the various
  pain-points associated with today’s serverless computing architecture.
