excerpt: >-
  From the rise of internet usage across the world, I have observed lot of fake
  social media posts about healthcare systems. Also it has been observed that
  most of the people nowadays instead of consulting with doctor, they just surf
  on internet, read few blog posts and try to purchase medicines and consume it
  without knowing it’s side effects which can harm them in longer run.
