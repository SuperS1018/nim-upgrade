  Recently I participated in a hackathon (#DeveloperIPL Game) organized by
  HackerEarth , Nimbella & Postman to build serverless apps for social good.
  Nimbella is a platform to deploy serverless web apps, api’s & functions. I am
  writing this blog post to walkthrough how to deploy simple web api’s with
  quick turnaround times (literally in minutes) using nimbella & python.
