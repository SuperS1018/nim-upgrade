excerpt: >-
  One of my current tasks at Postman is to help explore what the future of API
  deployment looks like. When I went into this work I expected serverless to
  play a significant role, but I have to admit I didnâ€™t anticipate the ways in
  which serverless would be used to reduce the steps it takes to actually deploy
  APIs.
