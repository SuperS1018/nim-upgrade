  Eric and I have known each other since 2000 when we worked at a startup,
  Speedera, where he was a cofounder and VP Engineering. It often felt like
  Speedera went through every possible startup experience: running from Internet
  boom to bust; from lots of cash on-hand to no cash; from scary litigation to
  fun times like taking the entire company on trips to Hawaii (twice!); and,
  finally, being acquired by Akamai. We weathered each challenge, enjoying the
  up times and surviving the tough ones, and came out as a coherent and
  resilient team. We loved the culture that we built at Speedera, loved working
  with each other, and held out hope we could do it again. So, when Eric was
  ready to fire up his next venture after 12 long years, I was thrilled when he
  asked me to jump in from the get-go. I had worked at 4 startups, all of them
  have been successful, but I had always delivered that success for other
  people’s ideas: so when the opportunity knocked to be – a founder – there was
  no question that I would say ‘yes’.


  The startups that I worked at were all acquired by large companies; although
  each acquirer was a different company one reality stood out in each
  transaction: in no time that nimble, family-like startup culture rapidly
  morphed into a slower, more methodical, less personal big corporate culture.
  We agreed from the start that if we were going to do something together, we
  would build a company that would stand on its own and have a chance to
  establish, evolve, and maintain the same culture and philosophy that it was
  founded on. More than anything else, this is why we decided to start this
  journey.


  While we were on our quest for advisors and other folks from the serverless
  space, little did we know that two of the brightest minds on the east coast
  were working on a similar idea. Not only did we connect with Rodric and Perry,
  we discovered that they, too, they had left their comfortable jobs and were in
  the same phase as us. Perhaps it’s destiny that brought us together: we don’t
  just have complementary skill sets, but a shared vision of, and commitment to,
  building a company with the right culture, a place where the best and the
  brightest would like to come to work every day.


  Rodric and Perry were the co-creators of the serverless open-source project
  OpenWhisk at IBM Research (now Apache Openwhisk). They led the design and
  implementation of its core architecture, tooling and runtimes. Given that Eric
  has a deep well of experience in developing and running large-scale
  distributed systems, and I’ve been deeply embedded on the business side of
  distributed computing and cloud services, this was a clear case of
  complementary capabilities coming together to build something unique: the sum
  is so much greater than the sum of its parts. From my perspective this is
  something a little more than a dream team, as I’m not entirely sure I could
  have dreamed up something so naturally aligned.


  We also have an excellent group of investors who share our dream of building a
  great company together: Ashmeet Sidana from Engineering Capital, Nilanjana
  Bhowmik from Converge, Serik Kaldykulov from Elefund, and the Swildens
  Brothers!


  So now we are in this together at “Nimbella.” Nimbella comes from Nimbus
  (cloud) + Bella (beautiful in Spanish & Italian); for those keeping score at
  home, it is also a beautiful butterfly. Of course, like any self-respecting
  startup, we chose this name in no small part because .com was available!
  However, as time passes, we believe you will come to agree that it melds
  perfectly with our mantra of Making Your Cloud Beautiful.
