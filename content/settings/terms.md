      County, California to resolve any legal matter arising from the Terms.

      7. Neither party may assign any of its rights or obligations under these
      Terms, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written

      rights and obligations under these Terms, without consent of the other
      party, to its affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition,
      corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its
      assets not involving a direct competitor of the other party. A party’s
      sole remedy for any purported assignment by the other party in breach of
      this paragraph shall be, at the non-assigning party’s election,
      termination of your use of the Nimbella Services upon written notice to
      the assigning party.
