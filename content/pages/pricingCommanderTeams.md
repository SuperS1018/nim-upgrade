        [**Setup in
        Teams**](https://nimbella.com/docs/commander/microsoft-teams/quickstart#quickstart)**
        for free** and start using it.
      question: How do I get started?
    - answer: >-
        The Pro tier allows you to use Nimbella's underlying Serverless
        Platform. In addition, it provides you the ability to create many more
        commands each with their own set of permissions for command runners and
        coders. Tasks and Triggers will be included in the pro tier once they
        are supported. 
      question: What are the benefits of the Pro tier?
    - answer: >-
        The Nimbella Platform allows you to build reactive functions without
        provisioning servers or services. With platform access, you can build
        more complicated commands that bundle libraries and third-party
        dependencies, or take your development experience off-line to use your
        favorite IDE and tools. With the Nimbella Platform, you also unlock
        application monitoring and access to logs. If you need to build stateful
        commands, let us know and we'll unlock additional platform capabilities
        for you.
      question: What is Nimbella Platform access?
    - answer: >-
        Tasks run commands at scheduled times or at a given rate. Triggers allow
        an external webhook to trigger execution of a command and output the
        results to a particular channel. They are not supported in the Teams
        version at this time.
      question: What are tasks and triggers?
    - answer: >-
        Nimbella offers a complete cloud platform for building stateful
        serverless applications. The Nimbella cloud can be deployed with
        one-click to a cloud of your choice, including on-premise so you can
        keep all your code and data on your private infrastructure if you
        choose.
      question: How does an on-premise option work?
    - answer: An active user is one who runs 5 or more commands in a given month.
      question: What does an active user mean?
    - answer: >-
        You will find us on Nimbella channel in Mattermost Community. We also
        provide 24x7 support for Enterprise clients, including phone and email.
