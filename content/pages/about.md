  Nimbella is a serverless cloud that helps developers and organizations adopt a
  cloud strategy focused on rapidly delivering business value in a changing
  cloud landscape. Nimbella is backed by proven enterprise-grade open source
  software, and offers organizations the peace of mind of being able to run
  across multiple clouds, including private infrastructure.


  At Nimbella, we obsess over the developer experience. Our mission is borne out
  of our frustrations in using the public cloud vendors. Our technology fills
  the technology gaps that slow down and distract developers from delivering
  business value to their organizations and clients. The Nimbella platform
  unifies the programming experience for the cloud with a serverless foundation.
  In this way, we are able to deliver a complete and integrated solution that is
  enterprise-ready and works across clouds. Our technology is designed from the
  ground up to address the needs of event-based applications, long running
  applications, stateful workloads, and more complex use cases that employ
  artificial intelligence and machine learning.
