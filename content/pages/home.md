          With Nimbella, deploying my app was a breeze; all I had to care about
          was getting the functionality that I needed right and not be worried
          about the deployment. It helped in channeling most of my time in
          building the product that I wanted rather than thinking about how I
          will have to make it available.

          cloud so our solution needs to be non-proprietary and customizable.

          The adoption of a microservices approach in the Kubernetes environment
          is naturally evolving towards serverless. We are leveraging the
          cloud-agnostic approach that Nimbella offers, with a focus on
          enhancing developer productivity. The open-source base and superior
          developer experience was an excellent incentive to move towards a
          transparent, fully controllable solution.

          I spent significant amounts of time building collections for deploying
          APIs to AWS using Lambda earlier this year, so when I had an API
          deploying in just a couple of minutes with Nimbella, you can say I was
          pretty impressed with what they have done to serverless by making it
          easy, but also bringing in the critical ingredients you need to
          actually deliver meaningful apps.
