    > Nimbella fully embraces hybrid cloud with a FaaS-anywhere approach. Like
    IBM Cloud Functions, Nimbella is based on the open source Apache OpenWhisk
    project. Nimbella adds a simple, fast developer onboarding process to a
    runtime that developers can use in a pure FaaS model, as an installable
    function platform on other public clouds, or even on-premises. Nimbella
    delivers this FaaS-anywhere approach with robust container support, broad
    support for programming languages, and configurable settings for maximum
    function duration. The result: a FaaS solution that well suits long-running
    stateful functions.
