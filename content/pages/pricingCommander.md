        Just “Add Commander” to your messaging platform and you are ready to
        start.
      question: How do I get started?
    - answer: >-
        The Pro tier unlocks the capabilities that are not included in the free
        tier as indicated in the pricing table. As part of the pro tier you get
        access to Nimbella Cloud Platform. In addition, it provides you the
        ability to create multiple applications and a greater number of commands
        per application, so that you can assign different apps to different
        teams, each with their own set of permissions for administrators,
        command runners and coders (also depends on the messaging platform,
        check the pricing table).
      question: What are the benefits of the Pro tier?
    - answer: >-
        The Nimbella Cloud Platform allows you to build reactive functions
        without provisioning servers or services. With platform access, you can
        build more complicated commands that bundle libraries and third party
        dependencies, or take your development experience off-line to use your
        favorite IDE and tools. You can also unlock application monitoring and
        access to logs. If you need to build stateful commands, let us know and
        we'll unlock additional platform capabilities for you.
      question: What is Nimbella Cloud Platform access?
    - answer: >-
        Tasks run commands at scheduled times or at a given rate. Triggers allow
        an external webhook to trigger execution of a command and output the
        results to a particular channel. Some collaboration systems have
        limitations so please refer to Commander documentation for more details.
      question: What are tasks and triggers?
    - answer: >-
        Nimbella offers a complete cloud platform for building stateful
        serverless applications. The Nimbella cloud can be deployed with
        one-click to a cloud of your choice, including on-premise so you can
        keep all your code and data on your private infrastructure if you
        choose.
      question: How does an on-premise option work?
    - answer: >-
        An active user is one who runs 5 or more commands in a given month. The
        minimum charge of upgrading the account to Pro is 1 active user charge.
      question: What does an active user mean?
