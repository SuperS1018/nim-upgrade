      Nimbella Commander is an app development platform that allows users to
      create, run, and share your own custom commands without ever leaving the
      Mattermost environment. Review our
      [documentation](https://nimbella.com/docs/commander/mattermost/overview#what-is-commander)
      for more details on Commander.


      ## Why use Nimbella Commander?


      Commander allows you to build Mattermost apps without servers - create
      your commands and write your code, and Commander does the rest. Thereâ€™s
      nothing to install, no servers to manage, and no services you need to
      provision. Best of all, you use Commander from within Mattermost itself.
      With Commander you also get these additional capabilities that are
      unparalleled:


      * **Access Control**
        Control which Mattermost users can run commands, edit source code or administer your Mattermost apps. Add users to custom groups to allow for easier management of access rights. Assign groups permissions the same as you would a user.
      * **Secret Keys**
        Built-in secret key management to share your code freely without compromising security. API keys and sensitive data are encrypted and stored securely, and decrypted just-in-time only when your commands need them.
      * **Built-in Security**
        With all users and identities managed by Mattermost, you don't have to worry about security. Each command is separated in its own environment, and each app is in its own authenticated namespace.
      * **Tasks**
        Create fully programmable tasks that run on specified time intervals. For example, track your cloud spending or new user accounts daily.
      * **Triggers**
        Set up an external API to call your command with a trigger. Select a channel for the command to output into and give your command webhook to your external API.
      * **Audit Logs**
        Get the logs of each app, command, or user using Commander. Review the date/time, command, user, and status of each action.
      * **Command Sets - (Open sourced pre-built commands)**
        Command Sets allow developers around the world to easily create, share, and open-source commands. They also permit Mattermost users to readily install Command Sets into their own workspace. Check out the pre-built Command Sets we've open sourced [here](https://nimbella.com/docs/commander/mattermost/guide#command-sets).
