      easy to get started with the Nimbella [election starter project and
      APIs](https://electiondemo-apigcp.nimbella.io/).


      ### **Prizes**


      * A grand prize of $2020 and Nimbella swag for the best election-related
      app.

      * We are also giving away two $100 gift cards for improvements made to the
      Nimbella election starter project.
