      API-first development is a strategy in which APIs are treated as a
      first-class artifact of the development process, allowing disparate teams
      the ability to work with each other without interfering with internal
      development processes.


      API-first approach also puts the target developerâ€™s interests first as it
      allows to build the consensus among different stakeholders by involving
      also edges or seams of the application,  and then build the product on top
      of it (website, mobile application, SaaS software). By building on top of
      APIs with developers in mind, you and your developers are saving a lot of
      work while laying down the foundations for others to build on.


      This is particularly suited for cloud-native development as it allows
      rapid prototyping, supports a services ecosystem, and enables automated
      deployment, testing, and continuous delivery pipelines that are extremely
      important for modern applications.


      ## Benefits of the integration


      With Nimbella Postman Plugin, you can take your APIs into a serverless
      world seamlessly. The plugin enables developers to:


      * Automatically generate Nimbella Project structure with stubs, unit
      tests, and client code.

      * Generate language-specific project configuration, package/dependency
      management, and .gitignore files.

      * Generate Readme using collection description.

      * Update dummy API endpoints or non-existent URLs in the collection
      document with Nimbella namespace URLs that you get post-deployment.

      * Augment collection document with new Postman Tests.

      * Sync the updated collection to Postman Cloud.

      * Auto-convert version 1.0 collection into version 2.0.

      * Fetch responses in the collection from deployed URLs post-deployment.

      * Sync collection document to update in the Postman App.
