      Nimbella is a cloud-native software stack that delivers a runtime
      environment for serverless and containerized applications. It is a
      full-stack platform which can be deployed either on dedicated
      infrastructure, private or public clouds. Nimbella utilizes Kubernetes as
      part of its foundation but can also run on bare metal. It hides all
      aspects of Kubernetes, because, well, Kubernetes is designed for
      operators, not developers. The Nimbella platform administers the
      underlying components, including storage management, capacity
      provisioning, auto-scaling, identity management, monitoring, and logging.
      We are constantly adding new capabilities and currently we are working on
      including rich integration with event and streaming sources.

      * **Serverless foundation**: Nimbella extends [Apache
      OpenWhisk](https://openwhisk.apache.org) to provide an underlying
      serverless foundation. OpenWhisk is the leading open source platform for
      serverless computing, with proven enterprise-adoption at IBM, Adobe,
      Naver, and other large organizations.

      * **Developer Workbench**: Nimbella offers an advanced terminal which
      allows developers to enjoy the same cloud experience from their desktop to
      the browser. The Workbench complements IDEs and has powerful plugins to
      significantly enhance the development experience. It also enables “live”
      local development of full-stack applications, so that you can test
      directly in the cloud.

      * **Operator Dashboard**: Nimbella is available as a hosted service but is
      also available as a one-click deployment for private clouds and dedicated
      infrastructure. The Operator Dashboard provides one interface to manage
      and monitor all of the platform resources and is aimed at enterprise
      operators who want to oversee their own Nimbella platforms, whether in the
      cloud or on private infrastructure.

      * **Composition Engine**: At Nimbella, we believe there is a new
      programming model for the cloud that allows developers to bring APIs,
      functions, and containers together in a familiar programming abstraction.
      The composition engine allows developers to compose services, functions
      and APIs to satisfy the demands of new and emerging cloud applications.

      * **Logging Engine**: Rapid access to logs is critical for fast iteration
      during initial prototyping and development. Logging is also essential for
      large scale applications. Nimbella offers convenient and structured logs
      that are automatically indexed and available from the Workbench. Logs may
      also be routed to existing logging services such as Elastic or Splunk.

      * **Identity and Access Management (IAM) Integration**: The Nimbella
      platform provides easy integration to commonly used IAM tools such as
      Auth0.

      * **Cloud Director Load Balancer**: This allows the Nimbella platform to
      automatically load balance between public clouds or public and private
      clouds.

          One of the big challenges with current serverless computing models is
          the lack of support for stateful workloads. Nimbella’s unique approach
          addresses this challenge so that developers can build stateful
          applications from the outset. Now you can develop stateful, stateless,
          JAMstack, streaming or long-running applications that can operate at
          enterprise scale, with high performance and built-in security.
          Nimbella’s technology is also suited for complex use-cases that employ
          artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques.

          Nimbella provides a development workflow that naturally complements
          current developer tools. This allows you to rapidly deliver serverless
          applications from scratch, or gently migrate legacy code to the cloud.
          Nimbella provides all developers (front-end, back-end or full-stack)
          with a unified programming experience that extends from the desktop to
          the cloud. Start building, and let Nimbella handle the rest, including
          configuration of all integral services such as storage management,
          capacity provisioning, auto-scaling, monitoring, and logging. This
          shift of all infrastructure burdens to the Nimbella platform lets you
          focus on what you do best: deliver business value to your organization
          and clients.

          Nimbella is cloud-agnostic and can run on public and private clouds
          thus naturally supporting a hybrid or multi-cloud strategy. As a
          developer, you can code once and run on all clouds or your local
          machine, because you can deploy the Nimbella platform anywhere. Built
          with both Kubernetes, Virtual Machines, and the Edge in mind, Nimbella
          aims to liberate the enterprise from the fear of vendor lock-in: move
          your compute to your data, use the best of all the clouds, and extend
          the same uniform experience to your private infrastructure. The
          Nimbella platform is built from proven enterprise-grade open-source
          and can be deployed on-premise, but is also available as a managed and
          hosted service leveraging underlying cloud infrastructure from popular
          clouds providers.
        title: All Clouds
    subtitle: >-
      Nimbella is designed specifically to address the challenges developers
      face in adopting a serverless computing model. There is little doubt that
      serverless is radically changing the way cloud applications are developed.
      For the enterprise developers that have already taken notice, they’ve
      realized dramatic gains in agility, focus, and costs. Smaller teams can
      deliver large-scale distributed applications faster and more securely than
      ever before. Nimbella is dedicated to facilitating the widespread adoption
      of this computing paradigm and deliver a serverless cloud with a beautiful
      developer experience.
