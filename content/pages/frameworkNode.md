      ### How to deploy a serverless Node.js app with Nimbella?


      We made the platform easy for the user so you do not get lost in details
      with deploying. 


      **When your code is ready to run just type**


      ```

      nim project deploy

      ```


      **Deploying from GitHub? **


      To indicate you want to deploy from GitHub, use a project path that starts
      with one of the following.


      ```

      github:

      git@github.com:

      https://github.com/

      ```


      and then 


      ```

      nim project deploy github:nimbella/demo-projects/visits

      nim project deploy git@github.com:/my-account/my-repo-with-project/#dev

      ```

          Our starter accounts are free: you just have to [**sign
          up**](https://nimbella.com/signup) to get started. If you need more
          capabilities you can upgrade from Starter account to Pro account at
          any time.
        question: How do I get started?
      - answer: >-
          If you are the only developer the Starter free account is likely the
          best match for you. The Starter account provides you with all the
          capabilities of the platform with an amazing return. On the other
          hand, if you are part of a small team of developers and/or you are
          working with multiple projects at the same time, we suggest you the
          [**Pro account.**](https://nimbella.com/pricing/platform)

          [**The Playground
          **](https://apigcp.nimbella.io/wb/?command=playground) allows you the
          opportunity to try out a few capabilities of Nimbella’s web serverless
          platform anonymously, without the need of signing up and for free. You
          can create, run, stack and share up to 10 serverless functions in
          multiple languages like React, JS, Python, PHP, Go, Java, Swift and
          Typescript. However, the Playground has limits: maximum execution time
          is 3 seconds and the function may not consume more than 128 MB. If you
          start trying out the Playground and you decide to sign up for an
          account you can export the functions you have coded into your account.
        question: What is Nimbella’s Playground and what can I do with it?

          You will find us on [**Slack**](https://nimbella.com/slack) and you
