          Our starter accounts are free. You just have to create new account,
          [**sign up**](https://nimbella.com/signup) to get started. If you need
          more capabilities you can upgrade from Starter account to Pro account
          at any time.
        question: How do I get started?
      - answer: >-
          If you are the only developer the Starter free account is likely the
          best match for you. The Starter account provides you with all the
          capabilities of the platform with an amazing return. On the other
          hand, if you are part of a small team of developers and/or you are
          working with multiple projects at the same time, we suggest you the
          [Pro account.](https://nimbella.com/pricing/platform)
        question: Which tier/account type is best for me?
      - answer: >-
          [The Playground](https://apigcp.nimbella.io/wb/?command=playground)
          allows you the opportunity to try out a few capabilities of Nimbella’s
          web serverless platform anonymously, without the need of signing up
          and for free. You can create, run, stack and share up to 10 serverless
          functions in multiple languages like React, JS, Python, PHP, Go, Java,
          Swift and Typescript. However, the Playground has limits: maximum
          execution time is 3 seconds and the function may not consume more than
          128 MB. If you start trying out the Playground and you decide to sign
          up for an account you can export the functions you have coded into
          your account.
        question: What is Nimbella’s Playground and what can I do with it?
      - answer: >-
          You will find us on [Slack](https://nimbella.com/slack) and you can
          email us at any moment. If you are using our Enterprise account we
          provide 24x7 support.
