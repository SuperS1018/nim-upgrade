    #### Nimbella CLI<br>(Comand-Line-Interface)
           
    The CLI runs locally on the  terminal and integrates with the developerâ€™s typical development workflow. It allows a developer to manage, develop and deploy serverless APIs (and entire applications that include front-end and back-end) from their terminal. The key feature of the CLI is "project deploy" which deploys an entire project, to the Nimbella Platform.
    
    #### Nimbella<br>Workbench
           
    The [Workbench](https://apigcp.nimbella.io/wb/) allows developers to use CLI commands  directly in their browser. This allows for a uniform experience that extends from the desktop to the cloud. It also provides integrated logging and monitoring capabilities
