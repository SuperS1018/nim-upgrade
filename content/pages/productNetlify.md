      The Nimbella add-on provides Netlify developers with a powerful
      programming model for serverless functions and workflows, and features to
      build stateful APIs using Nimbella’s integrated key-value and object
      stores. The Nimbella add-on for Netlify also works great with our
      [Nimbella integration for Postman](postman) so you can test your APIs from
      one of the best API testing tools available.


      Simply put, using Netlify with Nimbella is awesome. The integration
      delivers the same magical experience you’ve grown accustomed to using
      Netlify, and enriches the experience further with powerful tools like
      Postman.

      We built a Nimbella add-on for Netlify so that you can use the best of two
      amazing services. With this integration, you can use Nimbella for
      serverless functions and stateful APIs seamlessly with Netlify's CDN,
      domain management, and automatic builds.

      The plugin enables developers to:


      * Use many languages for your serverless functions. For example: Python,
      PHP, Ruby, Rust, Typescript, Deno, Java, and Swift in addition to
      JavaScript and Golang.

      * Run functions for longer durations, and consume more events, not just
      HTTP requests.

      * Build exciting applications using the readily available Object Store.
      Your Nimbella functions can store static assets and dynamically generated
      files when you need it.

      * A built-in integrated Key-Value Store means you can also create stateful
      APIs out of the box. Share state between functions, handle complex payment
      flows, track user sessions, are a few examples of what you can now do.

      * Use the Nimbella command line (Nimbella CLI) tool to rapidly access
      function logs and performance data.

      * Access the Nimbella Workbench with its rich terminal experience from
      your browser. This allows you to develop and debug functions the same way
      you do from your terminal.
