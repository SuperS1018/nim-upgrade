    IMS Evolve considered various Serverless solutions but quickly realized that
    most of FaaS (Function-As-A-Service) Platforms often involves getting
    locked-in to proprietary technology stacks that add unneeded costs and
    services over time. It makes it hard to customize and also very difficult 
    to migrate away from that particular cloud. Alternative Kubernetes solutions
    that IMS Evolve tested were hard to install and bring up and the support
    model to guide IMS Evolve through troubleshooting issues was nonresponsive.
    They then engaged Nimbella Serverless that makes  serverless development on
    Kubernetes frictionless and portable.

    **IMS Evolve** is an Internet of Things (IoT) company reducing waste,
    maintenance costs and energy consumption for its customers with an
    innovative machine learning platform. The IMS Evolve platform delivers
    digital transformation without the need for costly capital investment by
    enhancing, not replacing, existing infrastructure.


    **The Digital Sandwich** consortium stresses that recent health and safety
    issues in the UK have started to undermine confidence in the production of
    ready-made foods, in addition to ongoing concerns about the conditions under
    which food is produced. The platform boosts confidence in the ready-made
    food supply chain.


    ### Technology Challenge


    The Cloud Development team values the truly portable serverless solution of
    the Nimbella offering with its multi-cloud serverless, complete flexibility
    on their solution on their own control. 


    **IMS Evolve realized these top key benefits:**


    * Simplified Developer Experience, the platform onboarding was done within
    an hour.

    * Completely customizable runtime environment.

    * No vendor lock-in. Ability to choose any deployment model: Multi-cloud,
    Hybrid cloud, Private cloud.

    * One platform for stateless and stateful APIs with native integration of
    state for automatic data management.

    We partnered with Nimbella because of the flexibility of their solution. IMS
    Evolve is building a traceability platform that will act as a digital twin
    for the UK food industry and a serverless architecture is ideal for such an
    application. This will be further extended to other industries like
    pharmaceuticals, automotive and aerospace. Nimbellaâ€™s multi-cloud serverless
    platform future-protects us to deploy anywhere and have complete control
    over our deployment enabling ultimate scalability as the ecosystem is
    adopted globally.
