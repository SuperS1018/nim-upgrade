excerpt: >-
  Apache OpenWhisk is a readily extensible serverless computing platform that
  supports functions authored in many programing languages including Node.js,
  Python, Swift, Java, and PHP. The set of supported languages extends beyond
  these five however, and includes Go as well as other compiled languages. In
  fact, a feature of OpenWhisk that has been around for some time, but not well
  documented, is its support for native binaries. With a native binary, any
  executable that is compatible with a standard OpenWhisk container may run as a
  serverless function, also known as an action.
