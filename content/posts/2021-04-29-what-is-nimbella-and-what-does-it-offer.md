### Why was Nimbella named the strong performer?

The report provides a 40-criterion evaluation of function-as-a-service (FaaS) platforms and identified the nine most significant ones and scored the vendors’ performance across three categories: current offering, strategy, and market presence.

**The Forrester report cites:**

> _“Nimbella fully embraces hybrid cloud with a FaaS-anywhere approach. Like IBM Cloud Functions, Nimbella is based on the open source Apache OpenWhisk project. Nimbella adds a simple, fast developer onboarding process to a runtime that developers can use in a pure FaaS model, as an installable function platform on other public clouds, or even on-premises. Nimbella delivers this FaaS-anywhere approach with robust container support, broad support for programming languages, and configurable settings for maximum function duration. The result: a FaaS solution that well suits long-running stateful functions.“_

Nimbella uses a cloud-native software stack that delivers a runtime environment for functions and containerized applications. It is available as a hosted, managed service and as a full-stack solution on any public or private Kubernetes environment to fully support an enterprise's multi-cloud strategy.
