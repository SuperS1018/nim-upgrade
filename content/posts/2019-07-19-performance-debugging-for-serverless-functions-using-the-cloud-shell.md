excerpt: >-
  The execution of functions that run in a serverless cloud is opaque for the
  most part. In general terms, when a serverless function is invoked, the
  platform accepts the request and provisions resources before it executes the
  function. We can refer to the duration between accepting the request and the
  start of the function execution as the “system time”. The system time along
  with the “user time” (i.e., the time consumed executing the function)
  contribute to the total time it takes to service a single function request.
