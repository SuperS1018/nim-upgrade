excerpt: >-
  Serverless computing with functions fundamentally reduces the amount of code
  you develop and deploy for cloud applications, eschewing the “server” parts,
  and allowing you to focus on just your functions. For a cloud native
  application, where functions are APIs, an integrated API gateway handles the
  routing of events and REST requests to your functions.
