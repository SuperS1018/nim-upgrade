excerpt: >-
  In this article, I show you how to use Apache OpenWhisk to create a serverless
  application that is composed from serverless functions. The functions are
  created and deployed as OpenWhisk actions. Similarly, the composition itself
  is an OpenWhisk action. This is particularly noteworthy in that compositions,
  therefore, may be further composed, leading one to develop reusable and
  modular serverless function-libraries.
