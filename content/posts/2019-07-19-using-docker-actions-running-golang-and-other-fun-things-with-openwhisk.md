excerpt: >-
  The latest Apache OpenWhisk offering on IBM Bluemix has several new
  enhancements, including performance tweaks for running actions as Docker
  containers.

  As a previous post explains, OpenWhisk supports Docker actions in OpenWhisk to
  execute binaries on demand without provisioning virtual machines. Docker
  actions are best suited to cases where it is difficult to refactor an
  application—for example, a monolithic C or Java application with third-party
  dependencies—into a small set of functions using one or more of the supported
  OpenWhisk runtimes and languages.
