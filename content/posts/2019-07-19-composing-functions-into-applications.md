excerpt: >-
  Serverless computing is a new model of programming for the cloud that has
  gained traction with developers because of key value propositions: little to
  no concern about infrastructure operations, auto provisioning and auto
  scaling, and pay-per-use with zero cost for idle time. The fastest disruption
  in serverless has occurred with Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS), which are
  cloud-native, usually stateless, functions that scale on demand. FaaS is now
  offered by all major cloud vendors, and IBM was an early entrant into this new
  market with OpenWhisk, now an open source Apache incubator and a growing open
  source community around it.
