Do you want to get started with stateful Serverless apps but you think it takes way too long to get set up and going? I’m going to show you how Nimbella enables you to quickly and easily get started building and deploying applications to the cloud.

To begin, you’ll need to go to Nimbella’s [Serverless Cloud App Development Website](https://nimbella.com) and create an account. You can either use your email and create a password. Or you can sign up using your GitHub account. Once you’re done with that, you can log in and get started.

Once you’re logged in, you’ll be directed to a page where you’ll get the Nimbella Command Line Interface (CLI) which you’ll use to deploy your app to the cloud.

If you scroll to the bottom of this page, you’ll see download buttons for 3 Nimbella CLI’s, as shown below: One each for Mac, Linux, and Windows.

When you click one, you’ll get a .exe file that will help you install that Nimbella CLI.

Once you have the .exe running, then:

* Select the components you want to install, 
* Select where you want the destination folder to be
* Select the last button to download the CLI.

Once that’s done, you’re all set to start launching applications to the Serverless cloud! You can confirm the Nimbella CLI is installed by checking the version of nim.

In the next blog, we’re going to go over our example projects and show you how simple it is to deploy and experiment with Nimbella’s current examples of Stateful serverless applications including OCR, Stock Trading, and a Chat application.
