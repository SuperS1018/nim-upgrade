Now, let’s give you a brief about FaaS Wars Season 1 and how it panned out so you can prepare for Season 2.

Season 1 of FaaS Wars turned out to be truly global. We had participation from countries across the world where maximum participation came from:

* India
* Italy
* Russia
* Poland
* United States of America
* Sri Lanka
* Canada 

The purpose of the competition was to initiate developers to learn Serverless while also having fun. We saw more than 1,800 FaaS Warriors and more than 500 awesome robots fight to win the title of the #ServerlessJedi Episode 1. There were 3 episodes in this season and with each passing season, the battles keep getting more intense. 

Developers actively made use of the [tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sh8iAE5hrt0&t=17s), [written guides](https://nimbella.com/blog/faas-wars-serverless-virtual-robot-competition), and [blog posts](https://nimbella.com/blog/the-faas-wars-alert) that we shared with them throughout the event to improve their chances of winning and quickly learn more about serverless computing.

By the end of the season, we had 2 winners, one of whom won two episodes. 

## What was FaaSWars?

**For those of you who aren’t familiar with FaaS Wars, let us help you with some information. **

**FaaS Wars was a three-month global robot coding competition** organized by Nimbella and members of the [Apache OpenWhisk community](https://openwhisk.apache.org/community.html). It was the first season of this competition and was live from Jan 2021 - March 2021 and had three episodes. 

The prize for the competition was a cash prize of up to $1,400, which was divided between the three stages. The winner of the first episode was awarded $200, the second episode winner won $400 and the winner of the third round received $800 in cash prizes.

### Partners that helped Nimbella during FaaS Wars

Nimbella partnered with several big names like [Incubate IND](https://www.incubateind.com/), [Java Mentor](https://www.java-mentor.com/), [Apptimia](https://www.apptimia.com/), [J/S Bangalore meet up group](https://www.meetup.com/JavaScriptMeetup/), [This Dot Media](https://www.thisdot.co/), [Bangalore CNFC meet up group](https://www.meetup.com/Bangalore-CNCF-Meetup/), [Girlscript.Tech](https://www.girlscript.tech/home) and [Anstack.io](https://www.antstack.io/). 

### What was FaaS Wars about?

Participants had to code their robots, use functions to guide them on the battlefield, shoot lasers at opponent robots, and defeat them on the battlefield. 

When a battle was fought, the winner of one round progressed to battle with the winner of another battle and the same continued until the final battle. 

### Who were the winners?

The final battle or the season finale was won by Michele Curci from Italy, who was also the winner of our episode 1. Michele was awarded $800 for the season finale and $200 for his victory in episode 1. The name of the robot that Michele used to fight the battles was Cortex2. Michele even supported other players by writing an elaborate [blog](https://towardsdev.com/how-i-built-my-first-serverless-robot-and-won-200-87127a0b108c) on how he coded his robot that helped him win.
