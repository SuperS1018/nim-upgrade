excerpt: >-
  Sometimes it is helpful to develop and test an action locally before deploying
  to the cloud. In this article, Iâ€™ll describe how to test an Apache OpenWhisk
  action locally using Docker and a helper Python script. This is an advanced
  feature. For a more friendly debugging experience, you may want to consider
  using the OpenWhisk Debugger instead.
